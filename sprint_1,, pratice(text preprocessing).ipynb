This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no.  I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look.  I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool?  Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land.  Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital.  So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers.

The problem I had was with the service. We walked in on a weekday around 11, the place was pretty packed and there was only one server on the floor. We grabbed a table and waited about 10 minutes before she came over with water. We told her were ready to order, to which she replied \"I am really busy and have other people who need to order ahead of you.\" In my 16 years as a chef, I have never heard a server say that. She didn't even offer to bring us coffee or anything. If anyone from Joe's is reading this, here's a little crash course in restaurant 101...if a customer says they're ready to order, TAKE THEIR DAMN ORDER! Anyway, we ended up walking out. Guess we'll be eating exclusively at Matt's Big Breakfast from now on.</td>\n",

I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.

None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrÃ©e or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!</td>\n",

It was the first chance hubby and I really had a chance to go out to eat without the kids,so we really wanted to make the most of our time.And we wre definetly able to do that here.Refills kept coming even after we had paid the bill.I also loved the live music from the jazz quartet making its way around the room.The only thing thats keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the tables were too close to each other,and it was so loud I could hear the discussion at the table next to me but I had a hard time hearing my huband across the table.I will definetly be going back to Pappadeux over and over again.</td>\n",

A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.</td>\n",

I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  \n",

The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor.</td>\n",

Hopefully, I'll make it to others...but if I could only get to the Camelback Inn, I'd be in heaven.

Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured. I drink some water and as I lounge there, I order a small, healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast). I swim a little, lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.  If I have planned it, I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment. I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time, I reschedule.</td>\n",

The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.\n",

The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made.

I also enjoy the humbolt, which is very similar, and the majic mushroom with sliced portabella mushrooms, teriyaki glaze, green bell peppers, pineapple and pepper jack cheese. The 8inch is soo big but makes a great and filling lunch. You can't beat the prices either. Get the garlic herb bread, it is the best. The only thing I do not like about this place is that the whole \"marijuana\" theme can get old and annoying. This location can also get really really busy and the sandwiches take time to make.

After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My \"corner\", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.\n",

       "After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.\n",
       "After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.\n",
       "I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.\n",
       "I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!\n",
       "I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.</td>\n",

       "First, if you are looking for exceptionally healthy food or have dietary-restrictions, you have a multitude of yummy choices.  The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.\n",

The Luau Pork plate is darn good, but my recommendation is get the Luau Pork sandwich instead.  It goes so much better on bread, than just by itself.

As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we weren't really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didn't seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan.\n",

If you're more of a Caramel person, they've got you covered as well, and of course there are a rainbow of Fruity Delights and Decadent Chocolate flavors too!

I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  \n",

We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten!

       "Anyway, anyone who knows me well appreciates the importance of toast in my life.  When I moved to Phoenix to work for a catholic hospital, my best friend bought me a \"Jesus toast\" stamp which puts an imprint of the Mary which appears better when the bread is toasted.  I guess she wanted me to fit in.\n",

       "So when I told my waiter I was having a \"bad toast experience\" and he blew me off, you can imagine the impact.  I ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies, Nutella, honey etc.  My oatmeal came out with over-buttered, grilled bruschetta-style toast; that's it--a plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread.  I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, \"this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the \"toast\" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, \"this is the toast that comes with your meal\".  My friend was getting embarrassed, so I gave it up and left.  How hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread?\n",

Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say \"Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?\" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. \n",

Luckily, our server came back later telling me she was confused and viola a delicious pineapple mojito was placed in my hands with a large slice of pineapple on the rim. It was amazing! So good, the husband had to order one for himself. Our party moved inside to a private room where we were given tiny menus with simple selections. The husband ordered the beef entree, steak with horseradish mashed potatoes and I ordered the scallops with corn polenta. While the scallops were delicious, the steak was super tender and moist! (Better than a fillet we had the night before!) For desert, I ordered the chocolate cake with coffee crema inside and the husband ordered the cheesecake. The cheesecake came in a cute mason jar and was amazing. I really liked my chocolate cake but the cheesecake was better. For once everything the husband ordered was better than what I had ordered!

First, to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas. You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in. Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things. The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect. \n",

       "\n",
       "No, I'm not talking about the fact that Modern Steak is conveniently (albeit awkwardly) located in Scottsdale's Fashion Square. Instead, I think back fondly on a delightful little cocktail -- Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil and lemon juice, served chilled in a martini glass (as expected), but also with a little carafe of extr drinky-drink (unexpected), complete with a suspended ice-ball to keep your drink cold while you sip -- without watering it down. GENIUS. \n",
       "\n",
       "Ok, ok, so you're wondering: why the 3 stars? Well, genius cocktails only get you so far. I like to think that I've sampled a fair number of steaks in my day, from frou-frou to straight-from-farm fresh, and I gotta say that the whole steak experience at Modern Steak was about a 3 -- not bad, but not amazing. Just pretty...average. And for $46, I'm not %100 convinced it was worth it. Let me elaborate:\n",
       "\n",
       " - 12 oz. filet: I ordered it three of their five sauces -- the Steak Sauce (which cost extra...bummer) and the House-Made Ketchup. Now, one of the sauces that I simply a-dore with a nice steak is a Peppercorn sauce...so I was a little bummed when they didn't have one. So after getting a recommendation for the Steak Sauce, I went with it, and it was...well, kind of a let down. I didn't love either sauce, truth be told. Granted, I haven't tried the other three, so I guess I'll have to go back and check them out, but all in all, my steak experience was lessened by these sauces, rather than heightened. Boo.\n",
       "\n",
       " - Sides: we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Yukon Gold Potato Puree. The sprouts were...meh, but I'm willing to admit that I've been spoiled by the best brussel sprouts of all time at a little place called Larchmont Grill in Los Feliz, CA. They are fantastic. But even so, I'm not convinced these were really that great...I felt they were a definite let down. As for the potatoes, they were literally SWIMMING in butter, which made them very difficult to eat...and to top it all off, both sides were pretty small, even for two people. \n",
       "\n",
       "All in all, I felt the level at which the meal was prepared was a bit sub-par considering the prices and what I can imagine they were going for...there are a lot of restaurants that do what they do, and do it a lot better, so if they want to compete, they're going to need to up their game. UP it. \n",
       "\n",
       "Combined with the fact that we were sitting awkwardly on the patio, which was really just sort of jutting out into the mall, I can't justify more than 3 stars. However, would I try it again? Absolutley. Get the steak? Maybe not. But I think that, for a relatively new restaurant, they're well on their way.</td>\n",

Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm.

I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. Ok, so you're probably saying \"with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?\" Well, what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs, cotija jack, pulled pork, tortillas, tomatillo verde? Yes please!!) but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal, which was delicious. The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture. The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to.

I like a firmer mattress, so I guess that's just my personal preference, but it wasn't like sleeping on a campus futon or anything. The towels were nice- nothing fancy, but definitely not the thin washed-out wisps of cloth that you might have expected at other places. The setup of the place was great- it's just like having a little studio apartment. Even had a coffeemaker, and an ironing board, which is strangely becoming a rarity these days.\n",

       "I have to make special mention of one thing- the pillows, for some reason, were absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I both agreed (and we're both flight attendants, so we KNOW hotels) that these were some of the best hotel pillows we've ever slept on. Couldn't exactly tell you why, but there was just something about them- proper amount of spring, cushioning, support, punchability, etc. \n",
       "\n",
       "If you need to be in Arizona on business, you couldn't pick a better place. The convenience is amazing- you're right near the highway and there's quite a bit of stuff within walking distance. We got some DELICIOUS takeout from some of the local restaurants, and it was SUPER Handy to have a microwave and kitchenette available within the room for our use!\n",
       "\n",
       "So yeah, I gotta say, I didn't mind this place one tiny little bit. If you're used to Marriotts, Hyatts, and other fancy hotels, then you need to know that this isn't one of them. But for a relatively no-frills \"home away from home\" type of place, this is perfect!!</td>\n",

The bread that came with it though was absolutely amazing, hands down one of the best breads I have ever had. It also had a mini salad with it that had a wonderful dressing so we focused more on the bread and salad as opposed to the calamari. For dinner I decided to go with the lamb and potatoes which was 3.5/5 stars. It had decent flavor but I definitely have had better. The potatoes were very delicious though :) My friend had the duck and potatoes and it wasn't gamey and fell right off the bone which was great. It had good flavor but once again I have had better. For desert I got the pear/almond pastry(tart? can't remember) and it was absolutely amazing!! Soooo delicious and had a great balance of sweetness and was the perfect size. My friend got the blueberry and lavender desert with red cake and white chocolate which was very good as well and you could taste the lavender which was delicious but overall I don't think I would have been able to eat the entire thing myself as the sweetness level was very high.\n",

       "Cited as \"the best pizza in America\" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protÃ©gÃ© of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. \n",
       "My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. \n",
       "When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another \"slice of heaven\". \n",
       "And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, \"Well, the wait hasn't changed\". \n",
       "Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, \"Are you cooking tonight?\" To which he replied, \"No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore.\" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. \n",
       "At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! \n",
       "So what makes for the \"best pizza in America\" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!</td>\n",

       "We let my friend Anthony do the ordering since he'd been many times before and he also has a vested interest of sorts... We started with two salads: the prosciutto, zucchini, and artichoke (my favorite) and the goat cheese and pear... also quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with either one.  We then had the truffled harvest mushroom and the spiced pepperoni pizzas.  Yum!  The thin crust and the combination of fresh ingredients on both of them were perfect!  \n",
       "\n",
       "Along the way, owner Julian Wright sat down with us to share some wine and conversation - he's fantastic!  While he was completely engaged in talking to our group, I could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly.  Every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group.  Our waitress was sweet and I liked that she gave some attitude back to Jared when he was joking around with her.\n",
       "\n",
       "We had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying  two bottles of wine (maybe more than that as I lost track) during that time.  One of them was a La Crema Pinot Noir, but I think we had a merlot as well and maybe another Italian Red.  I guess I'll have to go back and take notes next time.  Another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing.  \n",

I imagine that they have magnificent views of the desert and mountains when it's still light out. The dining room is pretty small, so I'd recommend reservations. If you can't get reservations, I'd caution against dining in the lounge. Although they serve the full menu there, the lounge is actually in its own room and usually pretty empty, so it would detract from the whole experience. The service here is pretty close to perfect - these are professionals, the kind of staff that's trained to stop and step aside as you walk past them, even if they're not in your way at all. The gourmet cuisine here is great - not as inventive as Binkley's, but just as well executed. The menu changes often, so I can't really recommend any particular dishes, other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup, the one dish that's always on the menu. I would not recommend ordering their foie gras, if it's on the menu. It was the only dish that really missed the mark. I've only had foie gras one other time before, at Picasso in Vegas, so I don't have that much of a basis of comparison, but the foie gras at Mosaic was way inferior to Picasso's phenomenal foie gras (my understanding is that the best foie gras should be firm, smooth, a little buttery - there's here was watery and blubbery). However, that was the only \"miss\" of the night, out of our many courses. For a special occasion or a splurge night out, you won't be disappointed by Mosaic's beautiful restaurant and surroundings, excellent staff, and wonderful food.</td>\n",

The bacon was crispy without being burnt, the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing, and the touch of apple put it over the top.  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.

No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  \n",

The french fries might be the best I have ever had. The Chocolate shake was good but a little too rich for my taste. My wife said that the Buffalo chicken sandwich she ate was the best chicken sandwich ever. Her ice tea was amazing. My eldest daughter had the grilled peanut butter and banana split which had chocolate chips, pineapple, strawberries and of course peanut butter that was very different but great! The only drawbacks were the sweet potato fires ( not bad but I have had much better) there was only one condiment and drink area and that was clear on the other side of the fairly large area of land and the lone garbage can was also quite far.

It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.  \n",

The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again, because the sliders are amazing.</td>\n",

If I'm in the area (god forbid), I'll def. eat there again, but I'm not going to drive from the E. Valley to go here.  Bonus points for having 7-Up in a bottle, made with sugar.</td>\n",

It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!\n",

I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).\n",

When I first saw it, I did not know what to think but after my first lick I was hooked. It tasted just like a sweet vanilla / honey ice cream with blue cheese crumbles mixed into it. I know it sounds weird but this ice cream is phenomenal. It was sweet, tangy and somewhat salty, all at the same time. Instead of just enjoying this ice cream alone I decided to make my own blue cheese sundae. They have many toppings to choose from, including bacon brittle. When all was said and done my creation contained two scoops of their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream topped with a salted caramel sauce, bacon brittle and a homemade marshmallow that was toasted with a blow torch. This sundae was exploding with flavor. Every bite was crunchy, salty, sweet, tangy and delicious. \n",

The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what \"vegan\" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.\n",

This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.\n",

       "Cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a \"torta\" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.\n",
       " \n",

       "The Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.\n",

       "The pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.\n",
       "\n",
       "The burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.\n",
       "\n",
       "I used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least. \n",
       "\n",
       "Another example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).\n",
       "\n",
       "The best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late.\n",

I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness!\n",

Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better?\n",
       "Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini.\n",

Wanda's is a small yet quaint, twelve tables inside and 5 outside. Outside is for sure seasonal, as summers are too hot and dead of winter can be too cold. Wait times on a Sunday or Saturday can be 10-15 minutes during the \"rush times\", which is a quarter the wait time you would experiece at the near-by chains. The menu offers a variety to satisfy and hunger (except if you want lunch on weekends, it's breakfast all day, lunch from 11-2 during the week). The burritos are awesome. Ladies, I guarantee you will take half home! My husband likes the Biscuits and Gravy. The bacon is amazing and addicting often I have to smack my families hands away from grooping a piece. French toast, cinnamon raisin french toast and pancakes if you brought your sweet tooth =)   Build your omeltes are good too (tip, add a side of salsa, you won't be sorry, it is made fresh daily and goes perfect with a ham and cheese omelete). Service is exceptionally friendly, a lot of regulars and the servers know what you usually drink and sometimes can have your order written unless you throw a curve ball and veer from your usual. \n",

What's even worse is that the mixed drinks run 6 DOLLARS for a really tiny glass. This place needs to get its act together. I'll be drinking beforehand and elsewhere in between sets from now on.

Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait. \n",
       "\n",
       "Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days. \n",
       "\n",
       "I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me.

I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes \"surpassed expectation.\" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.\n",
       "\n",

They are featuring a special menu for New Years, however you can order from it \"a la carte\", so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad.  It was delicious.  I love the combination of dates, goat cheese and orange slices.  I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops.  WOW, they were so sweet and tender.  They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.  The portion was generous, 5 scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.  I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).  I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.  I had a bite of his and it was great.  I cannot guarantee I won't stick to my usual dessert, but it was a closed one.  I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live.  It is such a great place.</td>\n",

It can't be that much better right? You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold. Can't wait to try out the downtown location.</td>\n",

The sweet young thing kept checking in on us...we were there at 3 in the afternoon so it was quiet...but gosh, the young girls had just been fawning over us all day! On the way home, I looked at my kiddo and realized he's pretty darn good looking...so maybe that explains all the delightful customer service that day! Anyway, I can understand some of the complaints about it being a little pricey, but I think you are really getting a quality product and that is worth it to me.

       "We stopped into Chompie's this past Friday morning on our way out of town for the long weekend. My husband and I have this obsession with breakfast bagels - in particular, breakfast bagels from one amazing joint that makes the absolute best breakfast bagel EVER in our college's hometown. We are always searching for a place as good as Bodo's...well, even 3/4 as good as Bodo's would do...and we never find it. Bodo's is about the most efficient bagel store on Earth (literally the line of 40-50 people is serviced in 10 minutes) and cheap, too!\n",
       "\n",
       "So, we decided to give Chompie's a whirl. I don't love the location - like everything else in Arizona, it is tucked into a strip mall. However, there was enough parking and we found it just fine. When you walk in, you're a bit confused as to where to go. Then you realize if you want to eat a full service sit down meal, head to the left - we didn't want to do this, but the food that I was eyeing from afar looked good. To the right is their bakery, which has some pretty appetizing cakes, cookies and desserts. Then there is this counter where you deduce that you order \"to go\" meals. We were overwhelmed by the menu but managed to pull ourselves together in time to order. We both had that initial panic attack of \"oh crap, I have never been here and the menu is longer than a 5 year old's Christmas list and I don't even know where to start because suddenly I feel like I can't even read English.\" Deep breath. It's not actually that overwhelming, just a tad unorganized. After ordering, we were instructed to walk all the way across the bakery to a random counter to pay. It was so random the way they had it set up, but we did as we were told and then we waited.\n",
       "\n",
       "My husband's sandwich took a while to make....again, I don't know how Bodo's does it, but Chompie's is probably 4 times slower. Or is it more appropriate to say that Bodo's is 4 times as fast? Whatever. Either way, Bodo's has the breakfast bagel process down perfectly. Waiting was fine, though...we weren't in a rush. When my husband's warm sandwich was finally ready, we got our stuff and then headed outside (there is nowhere to eat inside if you don't want to have a full service meal, which is one complaint I would make about this place). Who wants to eat their bagel outside when it's pushing 110 degrees? Not me. Even if I am under a strip mall canopy that provides some shade.\n",
       "\n",
       "Anyway, his sandwich was actually really tasty - warm and fresh and really yummy. My bagel was not toasted, which I had requested, which was slightly annoying. However, the bagel itself was very good. We will definitely be back for the food, and I totally recommend this place for grabbing some freshly baked bagels or desserts or whatever. They do have a deli counter as well (meats, cheese, etc). Our breakfast was less than $8 without drinks - fair enough.\n",
       "\n",
       "I just wish that the layout were a little better and that it was more efficient. I also wish I could have eaten inside. Next time we will likely just do the full service thing.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the end, it seems that nothing will ever compare to our beloved Bodo's in Charlottesville, Virginia.</td>\n",

They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.   It is a different approach but seriously good!

Once you get in there you'll see it's a fun place to be; a combination of hip/50's dinner with real all American food (especially breakfast).  I had the salami and eggs breakfast which was ok.  I thought the salami was way too salty.  The hash browns on the other hand are amazing.  They were made from real potatoes, cooked just right with plenty of grease and I loved every bite!  I also had a cup of coffee that was average at best.  My wife, on the other hand, had a glass of lemonade that was made from scratch and was sweetened with honey which we both thought was awesome.  If you're going to come here bring a small snack you can munch on outside because the wait could be up to an hour and a half.  Best thing is to call before you come and ask how long the wait is.</td>\n",

I was skeptical since, driving past, it is your typical \"hole in the wall\" kind of place, but I was not disappointed at ALL. The carne asada burrito is amazing, even the salad it comes with is great. I think my favorite thing aside from that would have to be the aguas frescas, particularly the orange one...SO good. You probably will not regret ordering a single thing from this menu. I've gone back countless times, one time bringing one of my friends who was convinced that anywhere a blonde gringa tried to take her for Mexican food would be craptastic, but she loved it too.</td>\n",

The pasta was amazing, I watched the chef make my pesto to order... mmmm basil!  Hottie devoured every bite, so I would say he enjoyed his chops too.

We ate the \"big night out\" prix fix menu and chose the \"Fusion\" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though. \n",

They have the most amazing and original selection of pizza.  No matter what you pick, it will be good.  If your favorite isn't available when you walk in, no problem! They will make it for you! If you are looking for a slice of heaven, you MUST try the salad pizza.  No, its not lettuce on crust!  It is simply the most unbelievable creation that includes artichokes, red pepper, and spinach.  It is great by itself, but ask for them to put balsamic dressing on top.  The balsamic takes it from being amazing to last meal quality :-)</td>\n",

       "The last time we were at Brio was in September to celebrate our 16th Anniversary...yes consecutive years, and it was a great evening!  Last night, no so much.  In all the years we've been going to Brio, we have NEVER had such HORRIBLE service....ever!\n",
       "The food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history I'll admit.  So off to get the drinks....15 minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you we'd been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 25 minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking we'd be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a 'trumpet' shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said \"Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles\".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!  \n",
       "Then it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/2 way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, we'd not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didn't, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now you're probably saying, 'why didn't you do something about it'?  We'd have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished he's known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if he'd been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess' he'd have known.  Do we still like Brio...YES...are we extremely disappointed with our service last night...YES.....</td>\n",

April Howland from Howland Studios was there painting and giving a live demonstration. I am not certain how often they have music and an artist but if you managed to catch them one of these nights, you won't be disappointed. Also, make sure you try one of their fruit smoothies.

We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system. \n",

(perhaps a little lemon pepper in the batter would have done some good) Lastly, the dish could have satisfied by just having a bit more cheese.

I dont know about you, but, when I order a salad, I expect a salad.  this was a salad, just not with any lettuce or salad look.  we ordered the caprese di pomodoro.  this dish is made with heirloom tomatoes, preserved lemon, herbs, fresh burrata mozzarella and extra virgin olive oil.  from the description, i assumed, dont ever assume, that this was going to have some spring mix as a salad base, then have the tomatoes witih cheese and basil, and then the lemon with olive oil as a dressing.  WRONG.  it was nothing more than what the description said.  it was two tomatoes cut in half, with a small amount of cheese and a few basil leaves and then the lemon preserve mixed with the olive oil on top.  dont get me wrong, this ws absolutely AMAZING, and I would love to have it again.

       "The food came pretty quickly and was warm. We didn't order any drinks because the fresh-squeezed one's are so expensive it's actually cheaper to buy one of their smoothies. The hawaain special- composed of 2 fried eggs, shredded Kalua Pork, cabbage and rice- was tasty, but a little bland. They gave my brother and I (we ordered the same thing) some soy sauce, but I would have preferred a nice dollop of ketchup instead of the sodium infested kikkoman. Other than that, the dish was delicious. They fried the eggs perfectly, the runny yolk making the rice and pork taste even better! I usually only like my eggs over-hard, so it was a pleasant surprise.\n",

The granola was good and the berries fresh and few. What can you expect for $5? In my opinion, a little better than that. My dad, opting for the unhealthy option got the huevos rancheros. He ate it so quickly I didn't get a taste, so I can only assume it was tasty.\n",

The only thing I can really complain about is the portion size. I would have liked them to be a bit bigger, but I was the only one that felt this way, maybe I eat too much?? I had the bone in porterhouse steak and it was pretty darn tasty. They serve the steaks with a variety of sauces to dip into, some of them were amazing, others were not. I would for sure recommend this place to someone looking for a 5 star dining experience. Make sure you bring your wallet cause this place is not cheap! Our meal was about $450 out the door for a table of 4. We ordered 3 apps, and 3 sides also and a bottle of wine. This restaurant is operated by Chef Jean George, I have no idea who he is, but the waiter and hostess both swear that he is someone to know. Judging by his cooking, I think I would get along just fine with him.  J&G is inside the Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, I was staying there so I figured I could add this place to my list of great American Steakhouses. My final opinion of this place, it is exactly what it says it is. They meet the B-Stew standard for a fine dining steakhouse. Also, there are great views of Camelback mountain. One last thing, the hostess at this place sold me on coming when I called for information. Very well trained and passionate about her job</td>\n",

Again, more waiting as the anesthesiologist had a crisis situation with another patient. At this time I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Nelson who was performing the surgery on her ankle. My impression of Dr. Nelson was that he was very warm, compassionate and informative. He asked for my phone number and said he would call me directly after mom's surgery with an update.....and he did! \n",

My boyfriend and I stayed here for a conference in late October, which is a great season in Arizona.  Our stay was a pleasure from beginning to end.  The resort is well-suited for special occasions (there was a wedding reception and an outdoor conference dinner during our stay).  Our room was very comfortable, with excellent set-up and a great view of the mountains from the balcony.  The resort includes a pool, a small gym, several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces, and the wonderful Alvadora spa (with massages, facials, outdoor-facing showers, and shaded lounge areas to your heart's content).  There are several mountain trails a short walk/ drive away from the resort, and downtown Scottsdale is 10-15 minutes away by car.  In all, a beautiful place for a special occasion!</td>\n",

ALLIGATOR! ooooh but then I wanted to try their oyster appetizers cause they sound good too....ahhhhhh their menu is full of yummy choices! It was difficult deciding what I wanted to get...but after much debate....my bf and I decided to order the Oyster Duo appetizer and share the Pappadeaux Platter -- which is an amazing sample platter of all the fried variety they offer on the fried seafood section of their menu. \n",

I got to also try a few pieces of the Crispy Fried Alligator from our friend's Appetizer Trio Platter - It was pretty good actually tastes like chicken...but surprisingly more tender - I was thinking alligator meat would be tough and rough but not at all....I wouldn't have known it's alligator meat if you didn't tell me. But now I can say I have had alligator meat!\n",

       "I was really excited for dessert cause I saw them carrying around a platter of sample of the desserts that they have...so when we were ready for dessert I was excited to see the dessert platter - unfortunately there was nothing on the dessert platter I wanted because they all looked really rich and sweet....such as their sweet potato pecan pie, key lime pie, praline cheesecake, praline bread pudding souffle or turtle fudge brownie was just too much even for the eyes..lol They were also massive in portions so I decided not to have any. \n",

       "\n",
       "Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. \n",

       "Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.\n",

The atmosphere was nice, and i was surprised at the range of patrons (a family of 5 with 3 fairly young children at one table, and a 10-top of blue hairs right next to us). Our server Charlie was very nice and helpful when it came to selections (from wine to food). We are trying out places in prep for a family visit, so we want to make sure we get a good sapling of the menu.\n",
       "\n",
       "We ordered a bottle of sauv blanc, and though the wine was delicious, it took about the half the meal for Charlie to bring out the marble chiller. Thankfully the wine started out pretty cold, so no harm no foul. I orderd a bowl of tortilla soup (one of my faves) and I was impressed witht he presentation and taste. The bring the bowl with the chicken and tortilla strips out then pour the broth from a pot right at your table. Helps keep the tortilla strips crisp and was a great presentation. The soup was delicious, though a little creamier than i normally like my tortilla soup. We also ordered the seared ahi with guac and THAT was amazing. The pepitas crackers were delicious and interesting and the ahi was perfect. Great app for sure. Plus, the bread and butter were super delicious too. Garlic biscuits, mini corn bread and pepper butter? so good!\n",
       "\n",
       "For entrees the boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin over grits and I ordered the signature Dr. Pepper BBQ Baby Back Ribs. We subbed fries for asparagus and green beans and ordered an extra side of their green chile mac and cheese. I know, a lot of food, but we planned on taking most of it home. Here's where it got interesting. Or should I say, boring. \n",
       "\n",
       "So far everything (except the chiller) had been delivered timely and was tasty. But when we realized we'd been waiting 30 mintues or so for our entrees to come (after they'd taken away our apps), it started to get a little annoying. After about 40-45 mintues, the manager came over and leet us know our tray of food had been dropped and had to be re-made. No problem! I understand accidents happen. But i think it would've done a lot to smooth us over if they'd told us right away the spill had happened rather than waiting until we were about eat the burger off the table next to us. RF did recognize the inconvenience though and completely took care of us when the bill came. So props to them for that, and we didn't even complain or ask for any special treatment.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the food finally arrived, the ribs were OUTSTANDING. the sauce was perfect, not to sweet, not to flat. And the meat was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were all good, but the really show-stopper was the mac and cheese. The crumble top was delicious and the cheese was melted and runny but not stringy or clumpy. Spicy from the green chiles but perfectly reasonable. I want another kettle of them right now. So good. The boyfriends dinner was also good, but i think my ribs and the mac and cheese were really the best part.\n",

I was disappointed they no longer do the pineapple upside down cake, which so many yelpers have recommended, but I loved the bread pudding as a substitute. the buttery sauce didn't reheat very well at home, but it was still very very good and the ice cream was a perfect complement. I would totally order it again. Like a muffin fresh from the oven, still a little gooey.\n",

First, if I moved the salad on my plate, there was a big pool of dressing on my plate. There is such a thing as a properly dressed salad, and this was not it. Way too much dressing. I might have been ok with that had the dressing been very good... which it wasn't. The balsamic dressing was too sweet, and was under seasoned (definitely needed more salt).\n",

I'm also not a huge fan of places where the dessert is almost as big (if not bigger) than the entree. Give me a couple bites of something amazing rather than a huge plate of something mediocre.

Because of Sue and our travel insurance (thank goodness we listened to the expert on this one!), we were able to change our honeymoon to a Sandals resort in the Bahamas and didn't miss a beat.

Like other studios, this place offers first timers a week-long pass for around $20. What I really like about this studio is their instructors and the fact that they keep their room darkened throughout the entire practice. I've have been going to another studio lately (for their first-time student deals) and their instructors bark out instructions non-stop plus they keep the lights on the whole time.

At first  I was thinking \"here we go; this is where I am going to get stuck!\", but I was all wrong!!!\n",

I'm a little afraid to review it since two of the places I've reviewed in Ahwatukee have now gone out of business (RIP Villalpandos and Grill Wrap Cafe). But hopefully neither of those are my fault since I gave them good reviews. :) The first time we went there I had the New Yorker (Hot Pastrami, Hot Corned Beef, and Cole Slaw with Russian Dressing on Rye). It was pretty good! It was piled high with tasty meat; but not so high like at those New York delis you see on those Man vs. Food type shows that you know there is no way you could even eat them unless you are a snake and can unhinge your jaw, yeah, not like that. My boyfriend got the French Dip, which disappointingly was not able to be on the French roll because they were out, but he said it was good anyway. They seem to be having a bit of trouble figuring out their prep. They always seem to be out of something, both times we've been. Either a meat or one of the kinds of bread. I don't know if they need to simplify their menu or if it will just take some time to figure out how much of everything they'll go through in a day; but I hope they figure it out before it's too late. The second time we went I had The Godmother, it is REALLY good!! That hot pepper relish and the garlic sauce TOTALLY make it amazing. It's super tasty! The boy had the Meatball sub which was really good also. It was not really a classic marinara, a bit spicy, but the meatballs themselves had a lot of good flavor. It's pretty cheap there to make it a \"meal\" with the drink and chips and of course the cookie always comes with it, which are really traditional and tasty. The service is really polite and friendly. You can tell they are really putting their heart and soul into this place to make it work, and I really hope they can be successful. We'll be in to support them when we can.</td>\n",

It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices.\" FYI - There's bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They aren't chopped into small pieces, it's like the whole stem but I ate everything.

       "Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!\n",

       "That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion.\n",
       "I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.\n",

       "And we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted.  When the casting was posted, he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent, I was glad.\n",
       "Why you may ask?  Because to me as a mom and a parent, it's very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude.  When he asked why he didn't get the part, I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role.  I also told him that it doesn't matter what role you get, if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts, you will capture the audience's attention and that will be your moment.\n",
       "He listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave.  And I was also excited for him because this time around, he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak!\n",
       "With each review, I've written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here I've included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsG07sMlZ5s&feature=related.  This time around, he started asking me if he was a main character, starting to understand the structure of a performance.  It was great to see his awareness growing.  I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here.  \n",
       "It will be an amazing experience!!\n",
       "Really, DST is about the kids.  Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities.  Once the curtain lifts, the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other.  It's fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage, being responsible for moving and arranging the set, take care of the tech, go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage.  It's all fabulous.\n",
       "If you have doubts of what kids can do, go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed.  Truly, if you believe in your kids, as DST shows again and again, your kids will shine and raise above your expectations!</td>\n",

Shrimp & fruit salad with the champagne dressing was amazing. Their house dressing is just as good. By far my fave meal is now brunch. I ordered the \"best egg white omelet you've ever had\" & I must agree! The omelet was huge and packed full of awesomeness and flavor. The drinks were only $3 a glass. Peach Bellini's, bloodies, G-Spot, mimosa's! I am hooked to brunch. They also serve late night, until 12am! FEZ I'm such a fan!</td>\n",

This is by far the best dojo I have ever run across.  You are welcomed when you enter the door, all your questions are asked whether they seem stupid or not. You are treated kindly and with respect from the get go - a very warm place to walk into.  I was so impressed with this place I signed my kids up immediately.  They have so many types of classes and the variety and time schedule they really try and have it work around your family so you have your time as well.  The teachers here are amazing and always do their best to make it the best class you have every time.  I would recommend this dojo to anyone that asks me - and I do.

So filling, in fact, that I couldn't finish them. I also got a side of mac and cheese which was not great, and I didn't eat a lot of it. Overall, I'd give this place a solid 3.

Nothing but really lame jazz and 90's soul music. Each song was progressively worse than the last, and I kid you not - Brian McKnight came on and I just about lost it.

I recently tried the asparagus soup which was deliciously creamy and rich.  The quiche I would also highly recommend.  I've ordered the lorraine as my entree on one occasion but have also sampled the spinach and goat cheese which was equally incredible.

We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.\n",

I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.\n",

It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.\n",

We ended up leaving, because I can spend time with just my group of friends at my house if I wanted to and we were looking more to have an outing.

Pizzeria Bianco might have em by an inch just based on pizza alone, but if you don't want to wait 2.5 hours for a pie, Cibo is the place to be, and almost as good.  And although Bianco has a 2.5 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the duration(which might be part of the reason the pie is so good), the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time..</td>\n",

The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband's. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didn't like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50.

Some variation in looks for the girls but not much, but then again, maybe there is more to select from at night. I'm a day club visitor, because I hate to pay cover and other unnecessary costs. This place has a nice size bar, and a freaking huge main stage, with three, yes count them, three two-story tall poles (And some of the girls climb all the way to the top!). And it doesn't end there, there was a more private but large room toward the back with another stage and tall pole. There's an upstairs to this place too! I like to wander, I have a curious sense of adventure. I found multiple smaller private rooms up there, along with small mirrored rooms with single chairs. You know for that kind of one-on-one that no ones all up in your business about kind of room, just you and the dancer...Then there is the balcony that wraps around the upper floor, plenty of seating, with DJ in the center, spinning whatever the ladies on stage ask for (this is rare, some DJ's will tell you to take a flying leap if you demand a song, so I've been told...).

I tested this with a 10k distance. I was 7 minutes faster with a run walk than running straight through.  look it up, may change your life too.

Swordfish was a fine attempt but I thought over citrified and small bit over cooked. The pork tacos were genius.

It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. \n",

The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. \n",
       "\n",
       "In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said \"you can't take that home\". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said \"you are not allowed to take the kimchi home\". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? \"Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?\" She hesitantly gave me a lid.\n",

I can't say for everyone I really don't like waiting a half hour for a table. Call me impatient I don't care,  I really do not think many restaurants deserve that title even on a Friday night. I do love that they have an entire menu for gluten free diners. It's so hard to find gluten free in restaurants don't even mention an entire menu! I was impressed! I ended up splitting artichokes with parmesan (ask for no bread crumbs) with my mom and got myself a chicken caesar. Both were decent. We did end up ordering a gluten free chocolate soufflÃ© (make sure to specify that you want it gluten free because they had a normal version as well) which was amazing and I would definitely go there just for that.

At this time I have taken only the spin classes and I must say the room is amazing.  The lights are awesome, the mirrored doors that open to the outdoors are very cool.   Last week Todd opened the doors and we did spinning in the rain.  It was so much fun.   I also have to agree with the reviewer, Emily, that Todd's class is fantastic.   It is filled with energy, great music, and is a very challenging ride.    The one complaint I have is that the class is only 45 minutes, I would prefer it be an hour especially given the cost.   I cannot comment on the yoga as I have not tried it but the yoga room also looks amazing.  The cafe is a nice addition and the menu items that I have tried have all been great.  I will definitely continue to do Todd's class when I can and hope to try out a couple of other instructors in the future.</td>\n",

Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us. We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day, but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry! Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant... It was spectacular!! The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face! Also, it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun. The food is absolutely amazing!! We split the \"IGNACIO\" Nachos which have black beans, tomato, queso mixto, jalapeÃ±o, chile de arbol, and radish, and the Barbbacoa \"Costillas\" berkshire pork spare ribs, chipotle-cider mustard bbq they were tender, juicy, and delicious! We tried the House Margarita the \"Distrito\" and the white \"Mexican Sangria\" both were spectacular!! I have never heard of a white sangria before.. But WOW it was amazing! All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and sincere. This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list! Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience!!!</td>\n",

All delicious and served with crostini, perfectly melt-in-your-mouth bartlett pears, pecans, honey and quince paste.  Great start.\n",

My dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes.  My mom got swordfish.  It was not cooked properly when it first came out, but they promptly corrected the problem, so i can't fault them for that.\n",

In addition, I want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served.

It is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question.\n",

They served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish.  My understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted.  I asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods, but I'm not sure (personally, for me, at least) that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger.\n",

       " \n",
       "Let me start with the positives - \n",
       " \n",
       "I love love that the place is so small and intimate.  Especially in comparison to most Valley restaurants that are just cavernous.  And with the European-style seating you have to get friendly with your neighbors.  Both of these things make this feel like a good NY restaurant.\n",
       " \n",
       "I also love the atmosphere and decor in general.  Very authentic Spanish, very laid back, not all hip and modern like most restaurants try to be these days.\n",
       " \n",
       "The service was extremely friendly, from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by.\n",
       " \n",
       "My husband really liked the Sangria (Tinto) - he said it wasn't very strong but tasted great.\n",
       " \n",
       "Indeed, all of the food tasted very good.  Our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard dessert.  But the Tortilla Patatas and the Gambas and the Spinach with Garbanzos were all great as well.\n",
       " \n",
       "Now to the negatives - \n",
       " \n",
       "Firstly, selection was dreadful all around.  The wine list was very minimal, and the very limited bar didn't help.  And there were only about 8 dishes to choose from.  When I go for Tapas, the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from!\n",
       " \n",
       "Every dish was DROWNED in oil.  Literally, bowls of oil.  The food just sat in my stomach afterwards, and I felt like I needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease.\n",
       " \n",
       "The sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent.  I know it's tapas, and I love me some tapas, but generally at tapas places I find you could likely split each dish three ways.  The Gambas and the Spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to 4 ways.  But then the Tortilla Patatas was barely large enough to split two ways, and then our two favorite dishes - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard - were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food.  There was a party of 4 next to us that put in 1 order of the Pork Tenderloin and the waitress said, \"You should really get 2 or 3 orders of that so everyone can try some.\"  3 orders for 4 people to try it?!\n",
       " \n",
       "Then, right along with the food size is the price.  $90 (incl tip) for the 4 tapas mentioned above, plus a glass of sangria, 2 glasses of wine, the dessert, and an espresso.  2 of the tapas were one bite per person.  Yikes.\n",
       " \n",
       "The food, while good, was nothing outstanding.  There was no dish that made me stop and say \"wow, now that is well done.\"  They were solid but not amazing.  (As opposed to the Lomo Embuchado at Cobras y Matadors in LA that I was ready to marry and make babies with).\n",
       "\n",
       "So all in all, I'd say a 3.5 star experience, rounded down because it just wasn't a 4 for me.  I can't help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley, Sol y Sombra in the DC Ranch, where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine (and a full bar) and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price.</td>\n",

My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought we'd try this place I had heard about. We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it. We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy. I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didn't have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and I'm always up for trying new things. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The Biancoverde was my favorite. It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing. It has left me wanting more to this day. The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties. I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again. In fact, I'll be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!</td>\n",

This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.\n",
       "\n",
       "Cochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a \"torta\" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.\n",
       " \n",
       "The other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).\n",
       "\n",
       "The Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.\n",
       "\n",
       "As I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).\n",
       "\n",
       "The pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.\n",
       "\n",
       "The burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.\n",
       "\n",
       "I used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least. \n",
       "\n",
       "Another example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).\n",
       "\n",
       "The best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late.</td>\n",

The only down part was that they had plastic dishes but, with all those people what are your choices.\n",

       "1.)  The space:  Cute slightly upper scale boutique \"farmhouse\".  Decor and lighting is warm yet modern.  The only miss: The beautiful tables.  They are heavily distressed with very deep grooves as if made from reclaimed wood.  There can't possibly be any way for them to clean the tables thoroughly - The thought of a small portion of everyone's food that has dined here before me staring at me -- especially as time goes on and those grooves fill up with food & germs grosses me out.  A piece of glass on each table is a definite food safety must.  To make matters worse, tables are set with your silverware on the bare table.  Silverware should never be placed on anything other than a fresh a napkin or table cloth.  \n",
       "\n",
       "2.)  The menu:  The menu they offer is a little different from your average restaurant which can make for a memorable experience.  However, putting a menu like theirs in a small but thick leather bound binder with just a couple items per page made us feel like unwelcome outsiders.  The incessant flipping between pages with types of entrees and sides and sauces was quite frustrating.  I recommend picking up the takeout menu at the front door and using that to navigate the menu.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.)  The service: Awkward but very friendly.  Our waiter seemed like a foodie fit for a restaurant like this, but his table presence left us feeling like we needed to make *him* comfortable talking to us or requesting anything.  I had to fight most of the meal to have more than 3-4 ice cubes in my iced tea.  After asking a couple members of the staff for a glass of ice, they kept bringing back my glass with just more tea and no more ice. At one point, the server brought my iced tea glass back without a straw.  When I asked for one, his reply was \"can you use the one from your water glass for now?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "4.)  The food:  This is what made up for most of the other shortcomings especially because Chick is still new.  I had the country pork with creamed corn and mashed potato \"bar\".  You get 3 toppings with the mashed potato which the chefs will assemble for you.  I chose mesquite sour cream, applewood smoked bacon, and Vermont white cheddar - Delicious!  The creamed corn was very tasty as well.  The mandarin orange chutney paired amazingly well with the pork.\n",

The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food.

The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).\n",

       "\n",
       "If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.\n",

The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.\n",

The dessert we had was amazing, three flavors of creme brulee..great to share and a nice change to the standard dish.   One thing to watch out for is that they will try to sell you on their wine special of the night....don't get me wrong it was a great bottle of wine but, they push it on everyone!!

The Southern Fried Chicken Breast is likely the best meal, though my pal is a huge fan of the Cuban Dip.\n",

But instead, he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by Asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to Arizona. Before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to Elements' kitchen! \n",

       "And to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for 12 INSIDE the kitchen. Not a new concept for restaurants, but something Chef Macmillian is so excited about. There's no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating, but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors. This new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience BEFORE the plate even reaches your table -  from seeing, smelling and hearing what's happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product.

The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals.  (The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!) After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hanson's.  (They have 21 locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.)\n",
       "\n",
       "My roommate and I went on July 2. They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.  $18/lb.  The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices. I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!  Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hanson's makes AJ's look like Fry's!  These were GORGEOUS!  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks I've ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa).\n",
       "\n",
       "Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.  Plus, I live very close to Schreiner's - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hanson's, I wouldn't make the hike to Chandler just for those.  The selection was quite impressive, though!\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!  (Hey - if you understood the context, it's a word, right?)  Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.  Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.  Nice selection of unique beer and wines.  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts! Yes, it's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.  OMG amazing meat!  Probably the best steak I've had in YEARS - and NY strip isn't even my cut of choice!\n",
       "\n",
       "The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.  (And I adore spicy!)  It's amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hanson's quite well - and are grateful there isn't one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often they'd be in!

The homemade sausage is excellent, the pizza is perfect, the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads (red potato dill is my favorite) and everything on the menu is fantastic. I have read that people say the wait is long, (which I find unfounded) but when you are considering what you are getting, the wait means nothing. I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt (bleh) and had worse service. I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good, fresh food any day. If you can't appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay. We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalco's is really tough. We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat. Don't pass the opportunity to try this place!!</td>\n",

Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.  Although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the Phoenix sun and heat, I would not wait for 4 to 6 hours as some people do.  So for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision.</td>\n",

I watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer.  Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem.  My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes.  Encore is not JUST family owned, it is a family environment.  I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants.  I couldn't recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns.  My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now.  I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family.</td>\n",

We just moved to Phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the Fox Restaurant Group. We happened upon CD on accident on a Tuesday night. I must say the place was pretty hoppin' for an early week night. We ordered the pretzels with fondue, the fried chicken and the steak. It was so good we didn't even speak to each other through the entire sitting. It was the kind of meal you don't mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness. Gross, I know, but you know what I'm talking about! The server we had was as good as a ghost. We never wanted for anything but he left us alone. I wasn't super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadn't had a ridiculously large meal 15 minutes before. I'd kinda like to shave off like a 1/4 of a star because the staff was ultra trendy/Indie as were a majority of the patrons. They looked like H&M and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if that's the gimmick I'm ok with it since the food was so amazing.</td>\n",

You will find many whimsical truffle flavor creations like Raspberry Rose, Mudslide, Strawberry Balsamic, Lavender Lemonade, Madras Curry, Avacado Wasabi, Maple-Smoked Bacon (yeah, I KNOW!)....and like a million more! AND the best news of all, is that she says she has perfected a dairy-free recipe for truffles...I. CAN'T. WAIT! I hope I'm the first to order that batch!!

However, she says that she normally sells her stuff at the South Scottsdale Farmers Market (Wednesdays) and the Tempe Farmers Market (on Warner and McClintock on Saturdays) In fact, if you go to her website, you can customize a box of chocolates and pick it up at the farmers market of your choice...

And from what I've been told, their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes. So I can't wait to see what they offer when I return. I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche, fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup. The soup was so rich and creamy, I could have ordered and ate a whole trough! It was that good. The fruit was clean, well portioned and fresh. I'm very particular with fruit, and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened. And the quiche was heavenly as well.

As you ascend the staircase to the second level, the reason for the long wait becomes apparent.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Once layered with crumbling plaster, the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork.  Other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area. Tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design.  The lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere.  No expense was spared when designing the bar and tables, which are made of dark exotic woods.  Seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth.  There are also several u-shaped sofas that create conversational areas.  Behind the bar you'll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm, yellow tone.  Thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors.  The \"soft opening\" menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others.  I tried a White Russian and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay.  Both were very good.  Prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience, were a good value.  I had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement.  After two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood, his vision has become reality.  In addition to a brief history of his endeavor, the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot.  Parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city.  The owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists.  Maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with First Fridays.  Within walking distance of Side Bar, dining includes Pei Wei, My Florist, and Zoe's Kitchen.   \n",

We both got \"The Farmer's Feast\" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here. \n",

       "The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) \n",
       "\n",
       "I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.\n",

       "One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite \"special occasion\" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber.</td>\n",

You just HAVE TO get it, done. In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce. SO tasty.

The two servers working the front of the house were friendly multi-taskers who welcomed, advised and fetched drinks while we decided on, then waited for our meal.

Apparently, it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next! Wow! I had the seared ahi-a huge portion of it spicily seasoned, lightly seared, and great tasting! The man had the stuffed chicken breast, and inhaled it. It looked great as well. Also in the \"great\" category were the side dishes! Omg, the cheddar massed potatoes were so freaking scrumptious I could die! I also had the jalapeÃ±o creamed corn, that I mixed with the potatoes to make a combo from heaven!

The food menu is interesting, a lot of appetizers.  Not enough salads for my taste. \n",
       "Compared to Arrogant Butcher and likely Tilted Kilt, the menu has less salads and less fried foods, but it'll be hard to find something healthy to eat.  It veers towards the comfort food side, with options like chili with cornbread souffle, and flatbreads served with burrata fondue.  There are a few flat bread options on the menu which is their version of pizza.  The day I went, the lunch room was busy. (You enter in through the a lobby shared with Stand Up Live).  Didn't get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection, will have to try that out the next time I'm here for a show.  The management and service is very friendly.  (Not in a scary way, just in a \"I really want to enjoy your experience way).  This is in sharp contrast to the service at Lucky Strike across the way which I've found to be downright rude at times.

I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on.  Lucky for me, there were several!  The one that was most appealing to me was the \"book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it.\"  I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it... I was in heaven!\n",

I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.  So much so that I bought a couple on my way out.  \n",

Unfortunately, Chef decided to go way off the grid, and serve it COLD.  I'm not talking room temp, I'm talking refrigerator cold.

By the time the plate is dropped and the server is telling you how your fluke is in a mascerated lima bean sauce with a marigold flower garnish and buttermilk glaze, you're not really into the ingredients, and just want to eat.

I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few \"adult\" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying \"who ordered pizza\" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called \"their customer service\" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm....

It is kind of funny also since we live in Circle Cross Ranch which is just right up the road from QCOM. I have passed this building so many times and just tossed it up to another little local farm out here. First we sampled all the olives and the different oils and dipping sauces. My husband complained he thinks the products are overpriced but I thought they were reasonable since they are really good and don't taste anything like the stuff you get in the supermarkets. After selecting a few items, I bought the mesquite almond stuffed olives and lemon and blood orange olive oils. Blood orange is amazing I can't wait to try it on a salad. I also bought a plain virgin olive oil.The oil is so flavorful and their claim is it is pesticide free since they don't have a problem with some sort of fruit fly they normally have problems with in olives here because of our dry hot climate. We decided to grab a bite. This was the only problem, not for me but for my husband. I guess this is a perfect place for the girls to get together for lunch but if you have a man that has a pretty hearty appetite like mine then he may not quite be satisfied with what he receives.It was perfect for me. I ordered a paninni that had roasted squash, peppers, arugula, fennel garlic aoli and a parmesan balsamic sauce on it. It was very good. Came with a side of kettle style potato chips and some olives. He had a salad but truthfully it was not a very big salad especially with the salads that could serve 3 you mostly see these days. I guess it is true Americans have come to expect quantity.That is ok, I would definitely go back. I will just have to make sure I leave him at home next time and go with one of my gals instead</td>\n",

       "The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.\n",
       "\n",
       "The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]\n",
       "\n",
       "The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.\n",
       "\n",
       "Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. \n",
       "\n",
       "The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. \n",
       "\n",
       "Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us \"you have to try the Vintage burger\", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.\n",
       "\n",
       "In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.\n",
       "\n",
       "Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.\n",
       "\n",
       "At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.\n",

We began with an appetizer called \"Table side guacamole\" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!

They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome.

The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate.

Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation.

       "Now this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.\n",

       "\n",
       "We also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.\n",

       "To finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of CrÃ¨me FraÃ®che that was also a hit.\n",
       "\n",
       "The owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.\n",

       "First, if you are looking for exceptionally healthy food or have dietary-restrictions, you have a multitude of yummy choices.  The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.\n",

       "FOOD\n",
       "--------\n",
       "Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the \"little ear\" pasta and \"alla puttanesca\" means it's made \"whore style\". \n",
       "\n",
       "And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.\n",
       "\n",
       "The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. \n",
       "\n",
       "And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.\n",
       "\n",
       "As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, \"oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this.\" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. \n",
       "\n",
       "SERVICE\n",
       "-------------\n",
       "Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. \n",
       "\n",
       "And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. \n",
       "\n",
       "SETTING\n",
       "-------------\n",
       "I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. \n",
       "\n",
       "The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. \n",
       "\n",
       "I definitely don't think this is going to be as \"scene-y\" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. \n",
       "\n",
       "EXTRA CRIB NOTES\n",
       "-----------------------------\n",
       "* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.\n",
       "* It's great\n",
       "* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.\n",
       "* it's great\n",
       "* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). \n",
       "* it's great\n",
       "* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.\n",
       "* it's great\n",
       "* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?\n",
       "* did I tell you it's great?\n",
       "\n",
       "ALL IN ALL\n",
       "---------------\n",
       "An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. \n",
       "\n",
       "I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.\n",

Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made.

       "     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.\n",
       "\n",
       "     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve. \n",

August is their \"Burger Daze\", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  \n",

They were not even butterflied, which would have made them appear bigger). But upon tasting them, I really enjoyed the flavor. They appeared to be freshly breaded (is it the same seasoned flour used for the chicken?) and were very tasty. My suggestion here would be to 1) butterfly the shrimp and 2) get a slightly larger shrimp (even if it means a price increase).\n",

I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said \"he\" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says \"yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!\" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.

She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.

Coffee was \"eh.\"  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.

       "I had the Choppino Fruittas de Mare. Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. \n",

The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. \n",

Food is all extremely fresh, and tasty.  The best time to go is when this place gets cranking, the style is smaller portions of the food, that have to be replaced very often when busy allowing for extremely fresh food.  Asian food is always good, and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you.  Italian station has fresh pizzas, that once again are made fresh for you, or order a custom calzone like I do.  Mexican station always has the staples, but recently had crab stuffed poblano rellenos!!!!  .  Berto's gelato with like 16 flavors is a great way to end your meal.

A few of my friends who have fine taste in food raved about it and so I had high hopes.  Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.  \n",

I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says \"Lunch Specials\" and where it says \"Sandwiches.\"  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?  \n",

After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.  \n",

       "My husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.  \n",

My curiosity finally got to me, so my boyfriend and I went in to try the food.  We waited quite a few minutes (easily 10 to 15) for our order, which is a good sign for fresh preparations.  The joint is hooked up with a juke box, pool table, dining area with tables and chairs, and two benches near the register, for those waiting to take their food home.  There were special desserts in a glass display cabinet, including coconut clusters and sweets I've seen in Mexico.  The assortment of beverages is outstanding, offering both Coke and Pepsi products, juices, CapriSun, horchata, beer, and Sunny Delight!  The menu is about par for Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, in terms of content and price.  I got a fish taco, which was outstanding!  No cheap tartar sauce here!  I also got a cheese quesadilla, which came garnished with lettuce and tomato slices.  The quesadilla was warm and fresh, on an obviously fresh tortilla filled with tasty cheese.  For the two of us to eat a few a la carte items from the menu, the total came to $11.00.  There are also combination plates available, as well as quite a few soups.  Overall, I was very impressed!  This looks like a fun place to hang out.  The food is definitely worth the wait.  I happened to ask the cashier, and they are open until 10pm on Saturday's.  Muy delicious!</td>\n",

For dinner I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boy had the chicken toscana.  Both had a very authentic Italian flavor that accompanies food made with care.

With a 4 star rating, I was expecting 4 star quality food. Well, some of it was good, but some of it could be better. First of all the atmosphere was pretty nice. It almost felt like Cheers, where everyone knew your name. Even though we didn't know anyone there, everyone talked to one another. The T.V. in the corner drew most everyone's attention. You could tell who the regulars were. They were up front and closest to the T.V. \n",
       "\n",
       "Most of the food was fresh. The Shrimp was very fresh and tasty. The rice was also seasoned probably and tasted almost as good as back East Chinese food, it just wasn't brown. Orange chicken was good, but a little hard. Not as moist and juicing like I wanted. The chicken was dry. It was flavors well, but was dry inside. Seems like it was under the heating lamp too long. The sweet & sour soup was good, but I've tasted much better. The egg drop soup wasn't too good though. Spare ribs weren't bad. Also a little dry, but not as bad as the chicken. The Egg-foo-yung was not good. Hockey puck shaped or not, it was too watery and didn't taste like real Egg-foo-yung. Everything else was pretty average. For the price, it wasn't bad. I would go back and eat there just so I could have the rice and shrimp. So pretty much 2 stars for the food and 1 for the atmosphere, service and cleanliness. Place was very clean and service was decent. Not a 4 star restaurant. Barely a 3 star. I think my wife gave it 2 stars. If you go there and find certain foods you like, it's probably worth the $5-$6 to go back and eat as much as you want of those particular foods. Skip the bad stuff and eat all of the good tasting foods. Other buffets will run you $10-$15, so this place could be a gem if the food gets better.</td>\n",

The Thai Peanut Sauce Pizza was a little weird, yet still tasty in its own way, and I could only handle one slice before growing tired of peanut sauce.  The Buffalo Chicken Wing Pizza was also pretty good. The highlight of the menu was the beer. The Elsie's Irish Cream, a milk stout, was one of the best stouts I've had (better than the Left Hand Stout). It had a strong coffee flavor but in a good way (I don't drink coffee). The Orange Blossom (mandarin orange hefeweizen) was the best Hefeweizen I've ever had, and I generally don't like Hefeweizens. The orange flavor definitely made that drink more than tolerable.

Some may disagree with me, but I still prefer Tempe's own Four Peaks. I feel Four Peaks' food is better, better seating, and the beers are just as good as Papago's flavors.

Nice thick slices of buttery hamachi, but all the seeds were scraped out of the jalapeno slices so they weren't packing much heat. After I ate them all, I remembered that there's a freakin recall on jalapenos in AZ and there wasn't a sign in the restaurant stating that their jalapenos are safe. JUST. EFFIN. GREAT. I hope I don't get salmonella. If you don't hear from me in a few days, pls call for help.. I live alone! And tell them, IT WAS THE JALAPENOS FROM YASU'S THAT DID ME IN!\n",

About 10 minutes later, the waitress asks if I'm all done.. I ask her about the ribeye and she asked the sushi chef & kitchen in a frantic tone.. They reassured us it was almost ready. Another 10 mins later, it arrives.. I guess it was worth the wait.. it was soo tender I was able to \"cut\" off the fat w/ my chopsticks. DEEE-FREAKIN-LISH. It could have used a lil salt, but that's just me being picky. The 3 sweet dipping sauces helped. Next time, I wanna try the duck sumibiyaki. \n",

Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! \n",

Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).\n",

Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat.

I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.\n",

       "The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.\n",

       "The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like \"I like it loose, like my women,\" is just not funny.\n",
       "\n",
       "Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal.</td>\n",

If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience.

       "We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much \"wrapper\" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.\n",
       "\n",
       "I still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.  I noticed some wine bottles in the back when I was picking up my food so that may entice me to dine-in at some point as well.</td>\n",

The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty.

His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.\n",

Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame. \n",

       "If you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey \"Chop\" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share. \n",

Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious. \n",

The individual sauces that you can order on the side were also nothing special.

No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  \n",

Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didn't sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I don't like it.

My wife said that the Buffalo chicken sandwich she ate was the best chicken sandwich ever. Her ice tea was amazing. My eldest daughter had the grilled peanut butter and banana split which had chocolate chips, pineapple, strawberries and of course peanut butter that was very different but great! The only drawbacks were the sweet potato fires ( not bad but I have had much better) there was only one condiment and drink area and that was clear on the other side of the fairly large area of land and the lone garbage can was also quite far.

This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly.

       "Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.</td>\n",

The bacon (I ordered the #9 All Star - cheddar, bacon, beef) was lame... thin, a bit stale-tasting, and not crispy.  The cheese was fine.

I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).\n",

I used to go to a really good Salvadorian restaurant in Seattle, and was excited to see there was one right near where I live now. So the BF and I got here at around 8 at night on a Sunday and it was actually pretty busy. This place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business, and I would have never seen it from the road, so it must be good to still be in business. So I ordered a pollo pupusa, a carne asada pupusa, and a polla tamale, and the BF ordered two bean and cheese pupusas and a carne asada pupusa and we split the pastelitos con papas y queso. Well, the pastelitos were pretty tasty, like fried mashed potatoes, and they came with a spicier cabbage slaw which I liked a lot better than the regular cabbage slaw for the pupusas. All of the pupusas were really good, my real problem was with the sauce. The red sauce that came with them was just kind of flavorless. The place I used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas... it was kind of disappointing. Also, about 5 minutes after we got the pupusas, the waitress came by and said 'oh I forgot to tell you we don't have any tamales.' Well, that kind of sucks, why did it take til we were already in the middle of eating to tell us? Also, it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend (since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken) which I guess shows that this place is cheap, which is good, but for this particular trip that wasn't good. So we decided to order a dessert to replace the tamale. We got the empanadas de platano with sweet cream. So this was a big deal for the waitress, she had already totaled out the bill and for some reason it was a huge deal to add a dessert at the end (which I thought was weird, but felt guilty about giving her extra work). Anyway, the empanadas were ok, but I've had better. The sweet cream is in the middle of the plantain and it isn't all that sweet. Oh well, I would definitely come back here for some yummy pupusas and maybe try a different dessert next time, the central american quesadilla looked pretty tasty....</td>\n",

One is the parking mentioned by other reviewers and the other is the bad service at the food court. I don't mean the samples handed out on almost every aisle and the hassle of the lines as stereotypical fat people line up like hippos at a rotten carcass to 'just try a sample'. I mean the little restaurant inside the store where the hippos line up to drown their peptides in sugar and grease. The food at any CC is outstanding fast food at an unbelievably good price. The pizza is fresh and really tasty and only 9.99 for a whole pie, the soft-serve yogurt is a huge portion in a plastic cup for 1.49. The hotdogs are terrific. Everything else is good and cheap too. There are no problems with the food quality and price. It's the service. The service is indifferent and inconsistent. Somedays it's ok to order pizza to be picked up later for a party, and somedays it is not ok and the workers will claim that it is not a service and never has been. Liars. Fat liars. I actually typed lairs by accident which works too. I'm done with this review due to boredom. I just can't stand it when a great business carelessly regresses to the mean. Brave the parking and the neutral service because when you need a good hotdog/pizza/frozen yogurt, it's a great spot.</td>\n",

The crust was thin, with just the right amount of fluffy in the edges, and with a nice char on the bottom from the pizza oven. The sauce was tangy and had a nice array of spices in it. It was also covered in garlic and fresh basil leaves. I really enjoyed this pizza. My husbands salad was lettuce, chopped carrots, cucumbers, roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, parm, all in a very tasty vinaigrette on top of a piece of flat bread. His salad was also very delicious.

We finally went  last night  before the Symphony and it was a very good dining experience. The food came impossibly fast. The shrimp and Sausage Po Boy sliders were heavenly. The bread is this roll type of joy like break back east. Yum. You know the type of bread you can't find in AZ or west of the Rockies as Al Pacino would say-lol!They also served the bread basket with a veggie type of garnish if mixed with butter and put on the bread it had a very pleasing taste to it. Innovative menu- Lobster Potpie and Duck Quesadillas. HMMMMMM! Interesting. I had a side of Mac and cheese which is what I had heard about for so long and a Caprese Salad. My friend had divine Salmon. I am not a Salmon fan but i tasted it and it was yummers. My Ice tea was tasty and my friend had  a Basil Mojito that was mixed well. I don't like them usually because they are so strong mouthwashy tasting, but this had a nice blend to it. The restaurant decor is beautiful.We did not get desert but I want to go back and try those Seasalt sticks. All in all I loved going here. DT was packed last night due to Wrestle-Mania but we were in and out  in an hour at 5ish, so try that time to avoid crowds. Service was great despite other reviews.

       "The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isn't too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so I'll give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isn't enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didn't taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.\n",

       " Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they don't do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking). So the experience wasn't a good one, BUT I would be willing to try it again, as I did have a very nice lunch there a few years ago.</td>\n",

And now I see why it has two stars...should have listened to the other yelpers -_-... went there is Good ole' Rada, thought it would be nice to enjoy the day outside.  Nearly Drowned by the ample amount of misters.  Thought to self...hmm well at least the food should be good.  Ordered the sliders meal... maybe they were scarce on meat, but the slider patties were the size of silver dollars, tasty but small.  Yes the service was slow; my glass was getting refilled faster by the misters than the actual waiter. It gets two stars in my book for the service and the overall experience (for lunch that is). you get what you pay for..and for 11 bucks, a couple barbie sized patties in human size buns, a not so 'AHH' diet coke, and 5 oz of wine (and that's on the 2.00 happy hour deal) ... kind of seems appropriate. \n",

       "When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation the place was crowded. The host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was. We sat down at our table and that's when things started turning out not as well as expected. Seated in a back corner--which I did not mind---I noticed the walls were filthy---scratched and beat up and dirty. That was my view, so of course its all I could focus on. The waiter did not show up for 5 min. to take our drink order, and when he did it took 20 min. to get them to us. He apologized, but at 8:45 on a Saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun. \n",

It was then we were told that they were out of the veal --which of course 2 of us had chosen by then, and that there was only one Skate dish--which of course the other 2 of us had decided on. They were also out of 3 other items. I felt I was back in the old Eleve (located in this same spot)--the food was great there as well---when they did not run out of many items on the menu. They may be ok when you have a larger menu, but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment. \n",
       "Gone were the pop rocks that I thought was so fun as an intermezzo, instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us. A simple salad--good--was $15---and most starters are at least that much. Good, but not worth the price. Otherwise, entrees were good--not special, but tasty and served with good presentation. The cotton candy is still there--and still an attention getter. And I still love the desert selections---especially the malt that I had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces. \n",
       "I think I am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive room--the energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room, but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as well--there are too many new, beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall. And they usually still have most menu selections on a Saturday night.</td>\n",

I went there on Saturday night with my husband around 7 pm and it was jam packed. Good for them! We felt a little out of place since it was a much much older crowd, (in bad capris, shorts and flip flops...doesn't anybody make an effort anymore? This part of town, I guess.) Anyway, we had a nice booth, but it was directly across from the pizza oven, so we were quite warm. Pleasant server, good busser/foodrunner keeping our waters filled. We decide to try the Bruschetta for a starter and the Rib-eye dinner for two for $28...an unbelievable price. The Bruschetta was quite good (and at $6 also a good value) and with a nice mozzerella and balsamic drizzle...it was tasty. The Rib-eye's on the other had, were not so nice. But, I must stress, these meals were $14 each...what did I expect? The steaks were large and tough; my husband said his tasted old. Yikes. Mine wasn't that bad, and the potatoes and veggies were flavorful. Our thoughts, under the premise of \"if we were running this restaurant\", are: we would have offered a much smaller but higher quality piece of steak. Food for thought, Javino's. In our opinion, quality over quantity every time.  As we were eating we were able to keep an eye on the drama with the staff...and  watch how hard those boys in the kitchen were working! It was really busy, and they all did seem to work well as a team, manager included. At one point, a sweet, young server comes back with a couple of plates to the manager  (I guess someone sent back there food) and burst into tears. Ah, we felt so bad! I hate it when customers make the server cry and if the food was no good how on earth is that her fault?! Well, major points to the manager who gave her a big hug and went to deal with the table. I was impressed. Also, live music going on... a very nice touch. We left feeling like it was an okay place, I liked better than my husband, but something was just kind of \"off\". Maybe they have an identity crisis? Are they a wine bar or are they trying to be fine dining? Either way, I definitely want to go back again soon to try something else on the menu. If for no other reason than how kind that manager was to the server. I have worked in the industry and have been treated like garbage in the same situation. So, kudos.

       "We stopped into Chompie's this past Friday morning on our way out of town for the long weekend. My husband and I have this obsession with breakfast bagels - in particular, breakfast bagels from one amazing joint that makes the absolute best breakfast bagel EVER in our college's hometown. We are always searching for a place as good as Bodo's...well, even 3/4 as good as Bodo's would do...and we never find it. Bodo's is about the most efficient bagel store on Earth (literally the line of 40-50 people is serviced in 10 minutes) and cheap, too!\n",
       "\n",
       "So, we decided to give Chompie's a whirl. I don't love the location - like everything else in Arizona, it is tucked into a strip mall. However, there was enough parking and we found it just fine. When you walk in, you're a bit confused as to where to go. Then you realize if you want to eat a full service sit down meal, head to the left - we didn't want to do this, but the food that I was eyeing from afar looked good. To the right is their bakery, which has some pretty appetizing cakes, cookies and desserts. Then there is this counter where you deduce that you order \"to go\" meals. We were overwhelmed by the menu but managed to pull ourselves together in time to order. We both had that initial panic attack of \"oh crap, I have never been here and the menu is longer than a 5 year old's Christmas list and I don't even know where to start because suddenly I feel like I can't even read English.\" Deep breath. It's not actually that overwhelming, just a tad unorganized. After ordering, we were instructed to walk all the way across the bakery to a random counter to pay. It was so random the way they had it set up, but we did as we were told and then we waited.\n",
       "\n",
       "My husband's sandwich took a while to make....again, I don't know how Bodo's does it, but Chompie's is probably 4 times slower. Or is it more appropriate to say that Bodo's is 4 times as fast? Whatever. Either way, Bodo's has the breakfast bagel process down perfectly. Waiting was fine, though...we weren't in a rush. When my husband's warm sandwich was finally ready, we got our stuff and then headed outside (there is nowhere to eat inside if you don't want to have a full service meal, which is one complaint I would make about this place). Who wants to eat their bagel outside when it's pushing 110 degrees? Not me. Even if I am under a strip mall canopy that provides some shade.\n",
       "\n",
       "Anyway, his sandwich was actually really tasty - warm and fresh and really yummy. My bagel was not toasted, which I had requested, which was slightly annoying. However, the bagel itself was very good. We will definitely be back for the food, and I totally recommend this place for grabbing some freshly baked bagels or desserts or whatever. They do have a deli counter as well (meats, cheese, etc). Our breakfast was less than $8 without drinks - fair enough.\n",
       "\n",
       "I just wish that the layout were a little better and that it was more efficient. I also wish I could have eaten inside. Next time we will likely just do the full service thing.\n",

I really wanted to get chicken instead of the pork, but they had unfortunately run out of chicken :( . My hubby got the full slab of pork ribs with sweet cut corn and mac 'n' cheese for his sides.

The cornbread was so-so, tasted like it came from a box, but the honey butter that comes with it made it pretty tasty. Regrettably, my husband's pork ribs were pretty fatty as compared to Lucille's (Tempe Marketplace). The root beer cake was good, but not as delectable as we thought it would be. Maybe we were expecting too much after reading how much fellow Yelpers enjoyed it? Another thing worth mentioning (some others have commented on it too) is how strange the beverage station is.

The answer took some time because, we were told, the waiter wasn't allowed to ask the chef directly and had to relay the question through an \"expeditor.\" There were a lot of people helping us, but it was actually too much - it was distracting to have so many different people - and none of them seemed very well trained.  For example, we got our entree and asked about the purÃ©e on one plate.

The fries are also great here - there's a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty.  Oh, and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer.

We chose this restaurant because it advertised gluten free pasta. Unfortunately, no one on staff seemed to know what \"gluten free\" meant. When we asked which sauces might be GF to go with the GF pasta, we were met with blank stares. It took several questions to determine that the marinara sauce \"might\" be GF -not very confidence inspiring. When we did get our meals, everything tasted fine, not fabulous, about on par with a Pei Wei type experience. I had a small side house salad, which was not on the menu, but was offered by the girl at the register.  The greens were nice, but not chilled, which was kind of yucky.  The balsamic vineagrette was not able to be GF certified, so I had it on the side.  It was just OK.  My GF pasta was cooked properly, and the portion was large but not too large.  I had the primavera with marinara sauce, and while the veggies seemed fresh, they were a tad overcooked.  My husband had a pizza, seemed to be pretty good.  My daughter had a kids meal of chicken tenders and fries--the tenders were a chicken breast cut into slices, which worked, and the fries were a tad bit reminiscent of Burger King's, with some parmesan thrown on top.  The kid's meal also came with mini donuts, which we had to ask for 3 times, but there were fresh out of the fryer and covered in cinammon sugar--yummy.  We ordered ice cream with a GF chocolate chip cookie--and what arrived was definitely not a \"cookie\"--more like a gluey, gooey chocolate chip amoeba at the bottom of a dish with 2 scoops of ice cream on top.  Eh.\n",

We ate the \"big night out\" prix fix menu and chose the \"Fusion\" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though. \n",

Their banh xeo (crispy rice crepes stuffed with beansprouts and shrimp) is awesome, and the generous seafood soup with white asparagus is something I'd order even on a hot day.

       "The food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history I'll admit.  So off to get the drinks....15 minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you we'd been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 25 minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking we'd be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a 'trumpet' shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said \"Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles\".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!  \n",
       "Then it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/2 way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, we'd not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didn't, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now you're probably saying, 'why didn't you do something about it'?  We'd have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished he's known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if he'd been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess' he'd have known.  Do we still like Brio...YES...are we extremely disappointed with our service last night...YES.....</td>\n",

I thought it sounded good and I love trying new places, so we went. The place was busy, we almost left because there were no parking spaces left... luckily we made one more pass and someone was just walking to his car to leave. There was a little bit of a wait, but not bad. So the inside of this place is really cute, with the wood paneling and all. We got a cute little booth. We both ordered coffee, which was very meh. Really watered down coffee and cost 2.25 a cup. For breakfast, I ordered the spanish omelet and the BF got biscuits and gravy. The omelet was really good. It had a kind of spicy sauce on it that was tasty and I added cheddar which really went well with the sauce. The potatoes that it came with were nothing special, no real flavor. It also came with toast which was what it was. That cost 9$. The BF liked his B&G but thought it was a bit salty. It cost around 8$ with bacon. Overall, I'd say the place was good, but not great. For the 27$ I spent after tip, I could have gone to Liberty Market which is much much better, so I probably wouldn't come back here.</td>\n",

       "I do plan to return when excessive day drinking has not blurred my perspective, but I remember having some pretty solid food. I sampled the Fontina cheese appetizer, perhaps my expectations were askew but I was surprised to see cheese sticks. I suppose I envisioned a wedge of cheese, either way it tasted fine and the pair of dipping sauces were unique. Sharing the same dish a savory romesco balanced with a sweeter pear sauce, I enjoyed them both with the cheese. Skirt steak is spiced nicely with garlic, chile and cumin ,charred and sliced, smothered with tasty mushrooms comforted by a hearty scoop of Yukon mashers. Not my optimum presentation as I like to cut it myself. I think the beef, which tasted great, went beyond the medium rare request which seemed to just be ignored. Not enough resting time from grilling to cutting and plating I would guess, however the meat was still juicy .I also had the chance to sample the maple glazed pork with pear crisps. Yum. Well cooked ,juicy and chock full of smoky sweet goodness. The side of Gorgonzola grits was a bit loose, but the flavor was very nice. Portions were very generous. \n",

Bruschetta and antipasto were tasty.  For entrees, we ordered the homemade Fettuccine Bolognese, Spaghetti al Pomodoro, the Chicken Saltimbocca and a special, Farfalle with shrimp and asparagus.

I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this, but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even that busy!  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table, and acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.  What kind of service is that!?  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace, but it wasn't.  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl, less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.  I will NOT be going back, there's no point!

I would for sure recommend this place to someone looking for a 5 star dining experience. Make sure you bring your wallet cause this place is not cheap! Our meal was about $450 out the door for a table of 4. We ordered 3 apps, and 3 sides also and a bottle of wine. This restaurant is operated by Chef Jean George, I have no idea who he is, but the waiter and hostess both swear that he is someone to know. Judging by his cooking, I think I would get along just fine with him.  J&G is inside the Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, I was staying there so I figured I could add this place to my list of great American Steakhouses. My final opinion of this place, it is exactly what it says it is. They meet the B-Stew standard for a fine dining steakhouse. Also, there are great views of Camelback mountain.

The bring the bowl with the chicken and tortilla strips out then pour the broth from a pot right at your table. Helps keep the tortilla strips crisp and was a great presentation. The soup was delicious, though a little creamier than i normally like my tortilla soup. We also ordered the seared ahi with guac and THAT was amazing. The pepitas crackers were delicious and interesting and the ahi was perfect. Great app for sure. Plus, the bread and butter were super delicious too. Garlic biscuits, mini corn bread and pepper butter? so good!\n",

But when we realized we'd been waiting 30 mintues or so for our entrees to come (after they'd taken away our apps), it started to get a little annoying. After about 40-45 mintues, the manager came over and leet us know our tray of food had been dropped and had to be re-made. No problem! I understand accidents happen. But i think it would've done a lot to smooth us over if they'd told us right away the spill had happened rather than waiting until we were about eat the burger off the table next to us. RF did recognize the inconvenience though and completely took care of us when the bill came. So props to them for that, and we didn't even complain or ask for any special treatment.\n",

The veggies were all good, but the really show-stopper was the mac and cheese. The crumble top was delicious and the cheese was melted and runny but not stringy or clumpy. Spicy from the green chiles but perfectly reasonable. I want another kettle of them right now. So good. The boyfriends dinner was also good, but i think my ribs and the mac and cheese were really the best part.\n",

The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about.  It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us.  However, I will say the bed sucked.  When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him.  They badly need to upgrade to better beds.

However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests.  And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool.  Suggestion to hotel:  Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile?  It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all.  And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall.  Almost too much shade.  It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade.  It made me majorly pissy.  Sun is why I came to AZ.\n",

       "Let me explain.\n",
       "\n",
       "1) Rose & Crown - The Hours. If it is really meant to be a British pub and a new asset to downtown nightlife, it needs to strongly declare A) YES! WE ARE OPEN! and B) YES! WE ARE OPEN *LATE*! When you're turned away when you excitedly show up at midnight on a Saturday because they decided to close for whatever reason, you're not going to be too excited about trying to go back the next time. What's a British pub doing closing so early? I went out of my way to go here, to experience this new bar and enjoy its offerings, and was sent packing. Meh. So I was surprised when a bunch of Yelpers decided to make it a meetup spot a few weeks later. Well, maybe this time, at 10:30, we'd be more fortunate with it staying open. \n",
       "\n",
       "And we were. Rock on.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) Rose & Crown - The Setting. I gather that the business owners are extremely limited with how much they can change with the house since it's probably a landmark with stringent regulations on how much of the interior can be changed, but since I've eaten at Circa 1900 a number of times before it vacated the premises, walking in here felt exactly the same. Sitting at the EXACT same 4-top table I ate before. The room hadn't changed one iota when it came to layout or furniture. Even the angles the tables were placed at. That was a little odd. The only main changes in the front west room were the giant visages of the Queen and good ol' Winston glaring down at you. In any case, it was kind of hard for me to make the mental transition from \"this is a sit-down restaurant\" to a \"this is going to be your local English pub\" when it comes to the indoors. Was it nice? Definitely. It's really nice inside. But pubby? No. That said, the front balcony is a really great location to hang out on, and I can imagine how great it'll be around springtime. But the balcony's more an asset of the great old house itself. \n",
       "\n",
       "3) Rose & Crown - The offerings. Standard selection of beers, including good ol' English standbys like Newcastle and Boddingtons on tap. Food menu not too big, but I thought the fish & chips looked appetizing, so I ordered those. I was skeptical, but to my surprise, the fish was great, as was their spin on the tartar sauce. Fries were also tasty, but fries are fries, and I'm going to devour them anyway because I was crazy hungry. But all in all, thumbs up on the food.\n",
       "\n",
       "4) Rose & Crown - The service. Was kind of there but more present at the beginning and then invisible near the end when were ready to leave, thus having to go back inside, tell the bar manager what we ordered since he didn't have the bill, and then pay him instead of our server. Kind of odd.\n",
       "\n",
       "So all in all, as I said already, 3.67 stars. I'm definitely willing to go back there and be open to editing my review and increasing its star wattage, but for now, it hasn't completely won me over. Definitely has a lot of promise, with its abundance of Britpop playing and proximity to Bianco, the sporting venues, ASU, etc., but they need to work on being consistently open late before I think about making this one of my definite go-to institutions.</td>\n",

I admit the whole make your own thing can be a little intimidating at first, just order one of their features rolls to get yourself started, then take off the training wheels on your next visit. You pick white or brown rice, meats, up to three veggies, and whatever sauces you want. The possibilities are endless! I've eaten enough sushi to know generally what works together, so I've been pretty happy with what I've come up with so far. The rolls are tasty and filling, and their traditional sides are great if you're super hungry. The only complaints I have are that the fish can be a little bland (even the so called 'spicy'), so you pretty much need to add a sauce of some kind. And some slices of fresh jalapeÃ±o!

I'm a little afraid to review it since two of the places I've reviewed in Ahwatukee have now gone out of business (RIP Villalpandos and Grill Wrap Cafe). But hopefully neither of those are my fault since I gave them good reviews. :) The first time we went there I had the New Yorker (Hot Pastrami, Hot Corned Beef, and Cole Slaw with Russian Dressing on Rye). It was pretty good! It was piled high with tasty meat; but not so high like at those New York delis you see on those Man vs. Food type shows that you know there is no way you could even eat them unless you are a snake and can unhinge your jaw, yeah, not like that. My boyfriend got the French Dip, which disappointingly was not able to be on the French roll because they were out, but he said it was good anyway. They seem to be having a bit of trouble figuring out their prep. They always seem to be out of something, both times we've been. Either a meat or one of the kinds of bread. I don't know if they need to simplify their menu or if it will just take some time to figure out how much of everything they'll go through in a day; but I hope they figure it out before it's too late. The second time we went I had The Godmother, it is REALLY good!! That hot pepper relish and the garlic sauce TOTALLY make it amazing. It's super tasty! The boy had the Meatball sub which was really good also. It was not really a classic marinara, a bit spicy, but the meatballs themselves had a lot of good flavor. It's pretty cheap there to make it a \"meal\" with the drink and chips and of course the cookie always comes with it, which are really traditional and tasty. The service is really polite and friendly. You can tell they are really putting their heart and soul into this place to make it work, and I really hope they can be successful. We'll be in to support them when we can.</td>\n",

Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family. It's fairly casual, but charming at the same time.</td>\n",

I had the 10oz rib eye with sides of green beans and applesauce. The steak was cut perfectly and it was a perfect size portion.

The quality of the pizza is always consistently great.  The garlic is not overpowering and is complimented well by the coal-fired flavor from the oven.

The shoulder cut chicken was perfectly cooked, but the meat itself was perhaps a little bland, although admittedly I do prefer chicken to be well-seasoned.  The goat cheese stuffing and the fig jam, however, resulted in an overall quite tasty dish.  I loved the mushroom risotto cakes served alongside!!\n",

Unfortunately, the market drives demand in a capitalist economy. Many people still look for huge and cheap. Companies provide huge and cheap.

A simple rally burger is a buck and change and seems like some of the non-value burgers at other fast food. Good condiment to meat ratio, and flavorful. And no skimping here...you get all the condiments even on a value burger: lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion...all that. The other thing I really liked was they have a value buffalo chicken burger which was actually really tasty.

I decided on a green chile burrito and my companion ordered the egg/chorizo/potato/cheese burrito.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our number was called.  The first thing I noticed was that the burritos were quite small.   I knew, however, that I was in for a real treat with the piping hot, super chewy freshly made tortilla, and I was not disappointed.  The green chile, while tasty, had too much liquid and after inadvertantly puncturing my tortilla, I was left with a handful of sauce.  \n",

When you're near Tempe Marketplace and don't want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a \"New York\" style pizza where as Spinato's is more of a homemade style pizza, and I don't say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinato's. I'll try outline my reasoning behind this choice.\n",
       "\n",
       "Slices just has their \"NY\" style pizza, and to be quite honest they don't even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do \"NY\" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezia's on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinato's does have an \"NY\" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good.\n",
       "\n",
       "On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order \"eat-in\". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept. \n",
       "\n",
       "The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian \"Traditional Vegetarian\" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza it'd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. I'm not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually don't care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices. \n",
       "\n",
       "This place has serious selection issues. Let's see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings.\n",
       "\n",
       "This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14\" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list. Its good pizza, it filled me up, it was tasty, but pizza is a competitive market.</td>\n",

I have been to Michael Minna in San Francisco, which is way more famous and crowded but this one is better.  Let's begin with something that impressed me.  When my partner and I sat down, someone came over and immediately handed her a black cloth napkin.  Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them.  Second, the food was great.  The duck fries were really good (and free)... I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect. (I never eat those). My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce.  My dessert was beignets and creme brulee.  The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good.  (My gf makes it much better)...we each had two drinks, a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo.  All in all, the food was tasty and the appearance of the place was nice and swanky.  It's about time Scottsdale started opening restaurants that can compete with S.F. and NY.</td>\n",

At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here. \n",
       "\n",
       "Tucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll. \n",
       "\n",
       "I usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal. \n",
       "\n",
       "Of all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa. \n",
       "\n",
       "Now who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup. \n",
       "\n",
       "The Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence. \n",
       "\n",
       "If you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup. My only question, where is the breakfast burrito?</td>\n",

Not only are the burgers here tasty, but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self-serve produce and condiment bars. One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddrucker's is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection.\n",

Knowing that I must have it for home use, my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle. This was just one example of how efficient, helpful, and friendly the staff here are. Next visit, I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as \"Mr. Crusty Baker\" (see photos).\n",

We started with the avocado egg rolls with cilantro honey dipping sauce.  These were the highlight of the meal-- the sweet sauce complimented the creamy avocado taste nicely.  My only qualm here was the $10.50 price tag for 2 standard sized egg rolls.  Seems a wee bit steep for what it was, but still very tasty.  I ordered the vegetarian tacos and they were good-- not wow, but good.  I appreciated the variety of vegetables and the fact that they had veggie tacos in the first place (many more standard Mexican restaurants do not).  I do wish they'd had more spices. The side of rice was pretty good, but not as flavorful as I'd like.  The veggie tacos are also served with some sort of pickled cabbage onion slaw (because the borracho beans that accompany the other dishes are cooked with bacon).  The slaw was also fine.  In general the food was acceptable, but a bit bland.  I should also mention that the portions are quite reasonable-- two smallish veggie tacos and a bit of rice and slaw.  Sometimes the portions as more traditional Mexican restaurants are absurdly gargantuan-- it was nice to see a normal sized and relatively healthy-seeming Mexican(ish) meal.\n",

If it wasn't at the Biltmore, I'd say it was a little steep, but considering its location, it's probably right on.  I'd go back if the food had wowed me, especially since it's in my neighborhood, but it didn't, so a repeat visit isn't likely.  There are enough solidly 4 and 5 star places in the vicinity that 3 stars doesn't generally make me a repeat customer.</td>\n",

In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me. \n",

The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautÃ©ed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as it's the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well.\n",

My girlfriend and I did not have any reservations, so we went downstairs in their bar area and ate the bar. You can order the Mew Mexican specialities or the Rokerij side of the menu. There was so much to choose from so we decided to eat off of the small plates menu. We chose the 3 small plates for $25. I was thinking the plates were going to be small and that we would not be filled. I appreciated that on the menu they told you how many \"pieces\" you were going to get of each item. The tenderloin on toast with triple cream brie was delicious. The amount of tenderloin was just right and the cream brie made it taste over the top. The scallops were cooked perfectly as well. Thoroughly enjoyed the taco sampler. Everything is fresh and the service was great. The couple next to us ordered off of the New Mexican cuisine side. The servings were ample and looked very tasty.

       "\n",
       "1.)  The space:  Cute slightly upper scale boutique \"farmhouse\".  Decor and lighting is warm yet modern.  The only miss: The beautiful tables.  They are heavily distressed with very deep grooves as if made from reclaimed wood.  There can't possibly be any way for them to clean the tables thoroughly - The thought of a small portion of everyone's food that has dined here before me staring at me -- especially as time goes on and those grooves fill up with food & germs grosses me out.  A piece of glass on each table is a definite food safety must.  To make matters worse, tables are set with your silverware on the bare table.  Silverware should never be placed on anything other than a fresh a napkin or table cloth.  \n",
       "\n",
       "2.)  The menu:  The menu they offer is a little different from your average restaurant which can make for a memorable experience.  However, putting a menu like theirs in a small but thick leather bound binder with just a couple items per page made us feel like unwelcome outsiders.  The incessant flipping between pages with types of entrees and sides and sauces was quite frustrating.  I recommend picking up the takeout menu at the front door and using that to navigate the menu.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.)  The service: Awkward but very friendly.  Our waiter seemed like a foodie fit for a restaurant like this, but his table presence left us feeling like we needed to make *him* comfortable talking to us or requesting anything.  I had to fight most of the meal to have more than 3-4 ice cubes in my iced tea.  After asking a couple members of the staff for a glass of ice, they kept bringing back my glass with just more tea and no more ice. At one point, the server brought my iced tea glass back without a straw.  When I asked for one, his reply was \"can you use the one from your water glass for now?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "4.)  The food:  This is what made up for most of the other shortcomings especially because Chick is still new.  I had the country pork with creamed corn and mashed potato \"bar\".  You get 3 toppings with the mashed potato which the chefs will assemble for you.  I chose mesquite sour cream, applewood smoked bacon, and Vermont white cheddar - Delicious!  The creamed corn was very tasty as well.  The mandarin orange chutney paired amazingly well with the pork.\n",

We also split the queso fundido (rich with cream cheesey chunks, whaaaat???). It was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch. The most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel. Between my 3 buddies and myself, we made quick work of that dish. Each of us had their house margarita which was strong (just like I like it), but I'm not entirely sure I'd order that drink for non-happy hour prices.

One time we will be there when it's not as hot out and get to try that nice large outdoor seating!  - I gotta say the Lemon Cake kicks ass!</td>\n",

       "I entered Mimi's Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever. I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food. i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out. i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle. She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before. i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide. She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley \"where's the fire? take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?\" wine was a perfect idea! I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine. i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine. When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news. Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help. It was just the olive branch i needed. Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better. i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion. finally my food was ready. She boxed everything with care for the drive home. All this time smiling. i couldn't help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange. She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi's Cafe. This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20. The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, I'm not sure these bills are right. i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20's but the difference would be her reward for honesty. The food was tasty and just what i needed. Mimi's Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table, and if Mimi's Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle.</td>\n",

I so want to be able to give it a higher rating but every time I go the service is really not that great. Last week I went for wing and Wii night, 30 cent wings cant be beat. I have had better wings, but hey this is a Mexican joint and our bill was not even $4! But our waitress looked like she could care less about being there, never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa and never stopped by the table to see if we like our food. Now being in the service industry and having spent many years as a server I get that you think since the bill is so low your tip is going to suck. That simply doesn't have to be the case, we left our server a $6 tip and we weren't even there long. You get 4 tables like that an hour you are set, so perk up and smile, you never know how far that can go. \n",

We had already finished our chips and salsa before we even got our water, took way to long, same with the food and it wasn't even that busy. We were sitting inside and there were only 20 people in the bar area and there was only one other table eating. Now our server wrote our order on her had, she seemed tired and frazzled, and we had to bring our bill to her at the end to check out, we waited a while before doing that. It seemed like she might have been the only server in the place, but she did have the help of a gentleman by the name of Frenchy.

       "We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.  When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!</td>\n",

I of course, looked at the reviews on yelp and was expecting a lukewarm time wih flavorless food.  I went to pepin last night and was pleasantly surprised to find the opposite.  There were 3 adults and 1 child in our party. My 2 1/2 yo decided to get cranky the moment we sat down.  The place was about 1/2 full.  Our waitress came right over to our table and started to take drink orders.  My mother didn't like the location of the table so they promptly moved us to a table of her satisfaction. The waitress saw my child was squirmy and offered to get her food out right away which she did.  I had the red sangria. It was good but I've had better. My mother had the tiramisu drink that was so strong it knocked her sandles off but it was good. I had the paella which was good and tasty. My mom had lamb which she enjoyed.  I forgot what the 3rd party had but he enjoyed his. My baby had chicken fingers and fries which were actually sliced potato and she ate most of it. The entertainment was great! I kept laughing to myself about the other reviewer who said they were intent on driving nails through the floor. Yes they were stomping up a storm but it was great. My baby was so entertained and yelling and clapping. Everyone was entertained by her too. Our bill came to $123 which is not bad for food and entertainment. Oh it was saturday night about 6:15pm</td>\n",

After chatting with a friend about possible lunch locations, he tells me about Georges Gyros, near University and Country Club.  I decide to give it a try, as it isn't too far from my destination.  Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors, I'm surprised I hadn't been there before, or, for that matter, even noticed it.  I guess when I hit SDL, I've got tunnel vision.  First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking, even at 12:30, for lunch.  Outer patio, stuck out into the parking lot, not overly appealing, might be nicer in the evening, I guess?  The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.  Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.  \"What's good?\"  He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.  Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.  With drink, under $9.  A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.  The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).  The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.  The sauce was also very good.  The pita?  Warm, soft and tasty.  The fries? Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.  Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.  Other items on the menu include several different gyros, burgers, sandwiches, a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers.  I plan on coming back, perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors...</td>\n",

The patio was about 2/3 full but the inside was empty.  When you first walk in, you are greeted with menus that are extremely reminiscent of Pei Wei.  Turns out, you order the exact same way at said restaurant and you even get a number and choose your own table.

The place started getting busy about 3 minutes after we sat down and I discovered the concept works quite well.\n",

Any restaurant that does peanut butter chip pancakes gets bonus points from me.  The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas (breakfast pizzas) to good ol pigs in a blanket.  The husband and I decided to share a few things.  We got the peanut butter chip pancakes, the pigs in a blanket, and a cinnamon roll.  The pancakes were awesome and HUGE!  After just one I was already feeling full.  The pigs in a blanket were absolutely delicious, primarily because of the yummy and kind of spicy breakfast link.  The cinnamon roll was also tasty, nice and fresh, but not too cinnamony.  \n",

Thankfully, I am completely wrong! Elephant Thai is a good thai place with a varied menu, freshly made food, and nice atmosphere. An added plus to the Tempe location was that they allowed us to bring our small pooch to the patio area where we dined. We did have the corn cakes, which were ok. I don't remember them being bad or great...but my husband likes corn a lot, and I think he enjoyed them more than me. The green papaya salad was as close  in flavor to the papaya salad we had freshly made for us on the beaches of Thailand as I'd expect around here. We also had the thom ka soup which was really tasty. It was a while ago, so I can't remember the entrees we got. I probably got the pad thai...just to try it, and some kind of meat dish. I definitely don't remember anything being awful...and although it might not have been exceptional food, it was enjoyable. Thai ice tea was yummy, and my husband had the limeade which was too tart for me, although he thought it was really sweet and quite good. I do remember that for 2 people, what we ordered was a huge amount of food that we had no chance of finishing, and yet the final bill was quite reasonable. \n",

Their breakfast sandwich is tasty as well but a little bit more on the dry (and healthy) side. Their ingredients are fresh as is their produce.

       "The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) \n",
       "\n",
       "I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.\n",

       "One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite \"special occasion\" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber.</td>\n",

Basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells.  its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies, like bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, etc,  that you can throw in the soup.   i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha.   we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good.

Then flash forward to the next day and if you're heating up second lunch (I like to eat) in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells, yeah you're doing a-ok! I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didn't think to call Jarred (sorry bud!). Eating alone certainly wasn't as much fun but it was delicious. Eggplant is a must. You just HAVE TO get it, done. In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce. SO tasty.

The parking is great, plenty of spaces to go around. You walk through the patio, not bad with all the misters, felt like I was in a rainforest, but very refreshing. So you walk a little further, watch the steps, and there's your bar. Very open, plenty of hightop tables and lots of TV's. The beer menu was plentiful. It should make everyone from the microbrewer to the coors drinker happy. I was pleased because they had plenty of vegetarian meals, or dishes you can substitute meat for veggies... and for you meat eaters out there, I was told the burgers were delicious and the waffle fries were soooo tasty. The staff was helpful and attentive as well. I would definitely add this into our Friday night rotation. If you're looking for microbrews, this is a place to check out.

Apparently, it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next! Wow! I had the seared ahi-a huge portion of it spicily seasoned, lightly seared, and great tasting! The man had the stuffed chicken breast, and inhaled it. It looked great as well. Also in the \"great\" category were the side dishes! Omg, the cheddar massed potatoes were so freaking scrumptious I could die! I also had the jalapeÃ±o creamed corn, that I mixed with the potatoes to make a combo from heaven! Man got the green chile cornbread casserole, which sounded meh, but tasted incredible! Such a fantastic meal! Stuffed with amazing food, and pampered by attentive servers, I was disappointed that I couldn't give Fuego 5 stars. But it wouldn't be prudent. \n",

       "Because the sangria sucked. I had both the white, that tasted like watered down kool-aid, and the red, that tasted like old, cheap red wine mixed with coke a cola. They both sucked. Not good. Hopefully it was an off night, beverage-wise and I just happened to be there for it. Everything else was spot-on!</td>\n",

Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?\n",

Very important feature, particularly with baseball where sitting down can become monotonous.  \n",

The dirt path from the mound to the plate is a throwback to the 30s, while the pool in the outfield adds a very unique and \"Arizona\" touch.  Pretty damn cool.  The classic clockface in centerfield is beautiful, and the grade of the stands are perfect for the noise to reflect off the metal structure.  Now that its under new management, they are opening the roof much more, which is a HUGE plus.  Many fans have been complaining about the lack of open air since the stadium opened.\n",

Its just looks so fucking bad, its almost embarrassing, and has prevented the outside of this architectural masterpiece from aging with grace.  How about HUUUGE pictures of current players, or true windows to let the light in and perhaps a view of the distant skyline?

That would be 284 days of uselessness.  \n",

       "I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.\n",
       "\n",
       "They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently \"better than baba!\" \n",

       "Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  \n",

The employees are fully compitent in their abilities and they seem happy to work there. They have homemade root beer, which is very tasty and leaves a smooth and flavorful aftertaste. They also serve Barq's Red Cream soda from tap, which is impossible to find anywhere in the southwest. The outdoor dining area has benches in a picnic style setting, while the indoor dining area features a vintage John Deere tractor as the center piece. The side dishes are kind of small (one scoop), so you might want to opt for and extra side...the mac and cheese rocks!! I also recommend getting cornbread or lemon cake for desert!!</td>\n",

The big plates came with 2 big serving of steamed white rice, 2 small cups of black beans sprinkled with cheese, half an ordinary avacado, 2 fried eggs (Chinese style, I cooked that all the time), 2 plain arepas (round flat breads), one chorizo sausage, one blood sausage, 2 scopes of shredded beef, one small steak, few green plantains, and few sweet plantains.\n",

And I can eat it plain. Arepas? What's that? It's an tasteless, odorless, chewy carb that didn't excite my taste buds a bit. Boring!!! Honestly, I had no clue how special it was supposed to be. It tasted better after I stuffed avocado and shredded beef inside.\n",

       "With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.  \n",

       "Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went.\n",
       "\n",
       "I had the pork belly, on Jamie's suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They weren't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.  \n",

The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited.

My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.\n",

My daughter got the brisket sandwich (she let me try a bite - nice combination of BBQ sauce, slaw and pickles - but she picked out the pickles and slaw!)  The fries were quite nice as well.  I tried the short ribs - asian fusion sauce with asparagus and jalapeÃ±o cheesy grits...I've never been a fan of grits, but these were tasty!  The ribs were very nice...the sauce reminded me of something my Mom used to make (but I can't quite put my finger on what it was, but it was familiar).  A browned with toffee flakes and gelato on top capped off a very nice dinner.  (And you've gotta love a place that has the Gadsden flag as part of it's decor).  Definitely will be coming back!  (and my apologies to our attentive and helpful server for not having been more demonstrative of my appreciation for the food...it was quite good, I just wasn't in a 'dang that's good!' mood last night)  Check this place out!!</td>\n",

       "The menus must have changed since other reviewers visited, because there was no Arabic on the menu. Everything is in English. I had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice. Both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that I have had at Fattoush many times- but this one was so much better. The falafel plate came with falafel of course, a questionable salad, pita that looked homemade, and some of the tastiest hummus i've ever had. It was a huge amount of food, but it was so good that I was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers. The lamb was apparently very tasty also- i'm not much of a lamb fan, so I didn't try it. The accompanying rice was very tasty though- very complex with many different flavors, but none of them were overwhelming. \n",

If I had to offer up any criticisms it would be 1) the fact that it inexplicably took something like 10 mins to make our sandwich - it just looked like it had been toasted, nothing else I could think of should have made it take that long, and 2) the sandwich was too small *8-) My mistake, of course. I got a whole, and could easily have downed two of those. Taste wise it's equivalent IMO to the \"all-American grinder\" at Uncle Sam's, except with the latter you can also get jalapenos.

Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni \"D\".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.\n",

Overall the place was decent. I am new in town and I am sure that there are better places to have a drink. I will most likely go back (in the future), just not in a rush to.</td>\n",

The interior would be mostly generic in appearance were it not for the somewhat ornate Middle-Eastern curtains, and a TV screen playing Uzbek and Russian music videos added to the ambiance. Large pictures of the main dishes in the counter area show you what they offer even before you are seated and handed a menu. For starters, we ordered Uzbek salad - tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet white onions lightly drizzled with a dill vinaigrette - and blinchik, which are crepes with a flavorful meat and onion stuffing; beware, the blinchik are rather filling by themselves. We also ordered palov and lamb kebabs. The palov was a dish of tasty seasoned rice with carrots and meat, and was quite a good choice. The lamb kebabs were juicy and flavorful, though the rice that came with it was on the dry side. A small basket of warm pita bread rounded up the meal. In all, it was a good meal, not great, but definitely satisfying. And I do hope to try the soup dishes next time.</td>\n",

The ingredients were fresh but there is nothing out of this world about iceberg lettuce and dry mozzarella. \n",

The waters came out immediately upon sitting down, then they took your drink order - as it should be. Neither my iced tea or water ever got below half a glass.  This is something I occasionally find annoying at places where the staff draws a lot of attention to itself when they refill drinks - particularly when it interrupts the flow of conversation.

This used to be listed under appetizers as the Grass Pie, but if you order a Grass Pie, they'll still know what you mean.  It is a cheeseless pizza with spinach and arrabiata sauce.  Confession:  I love all things arrabiata. But this combination here is perfect.  For about 1.50 (I can't recall the exact figure), they'll add mozzarella to it, but I've never done that because it is perfect as it.  \n",

The single prawn was large and equal in quality to the fresh prawns I had just tasted in New Zealand plus the fennel added more flavor.  The tartine of bouillabaisse was mostly small shrimp but again very tasty and tempting to order a bowl the next time around.  The three Medjul dates with sausage/bacon  was an unusual combination to my culinary experience and superb in flavor.  The select wines were about half the normal price and a definite value at $5 per glass.  In talking with the waiter I noticed there is live jazz on Fridays between 5 and 8.

I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.</td>\n",

We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful. This place uses quality ingredients.\n",

The ambiance out on the patio (when it's not too hot outside) is quite comfortable and cozy, with the fountain and the strings of lights.

The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.

       "Cited as \"the best pizza in America\" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protÃ©gÃ© of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. \n",
       "My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. \n",
       "When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another \"slice of heaven\". \n",
       "And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, \"Well, the wait hasn't changed\". \n",
       "Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, \"Are you cooking tonight?\" To which he replied, \"No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore.\" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. \n",
       "At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! \n",
       "So what makes for the \"best pizza in America\" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!</td>\n",

I imagine that they have magnificent views of the desert and mountains when it's still light out. The dining room is pretty small, so I'd recommend reservations. If you can't get reservations, I'd caution against dining in the lounge. Although they serve the full menu there, the lounge is actually in its own room and usually pretty empty, so it would detract from the whole experience. The service here is pretty close to perfect - these are professionals, the kind of staff that's trained to stop and step aside as you walk past them, even if they're not in your way at all. The gourmet cuisine here is great - not as inventive as Binkley's, but just as well executed. The menu changes often, so I can't really recommend any particular dishes, other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup, the one dish that's always on the menu. I would not recommend ordering their foie gras, if it's on the menu. It was the only dish that really missed the mark. I've only had foie gras one other time before, at Picasso in Vegas, so I don't have that much of a basis of comparison, but the foie gras at Mosaic was way inferior to Picasso's phenomenal foie gras (my understanding is that the best foie gras should be firm, smooth, a little buttery - there's here was watery and blubbery). However, that was the only \"miss\" of the night, out of our many courses. For a special occasion or a splurge night out, you won't be disappointed by Mosaic's beautiful restaurant and surroundings, excellent staff, and wonderful food.</td>\n",

It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta.

I stopped by with my children to check it out - planning to eat elsewhere because my daughter eats gluten-free, etc., etc.  Then I met Payton Curry and realized what he and the Brat HaÃ¼s are all about.  Great food and a desire to serve!  Payton delivered on fantastic organic salads that were gluten, egg, dairy, and soy-free and tasted great!  And he threw in a few organic surprises.  Now I have a place to eat phenomenal Moroccan lamb hot dogs while my daughter can enjoy healthy food.  On our second trip, Payton remembered us and came out to let us know he had made some falafel (in the shape of a sausage, of course) and offered my daughter one in a salad or a lettuce wrap.  She chose the wrap (more fun) and loved it.  I have NEVER had personalized service like this!  Cool place, cool patio, great beer selection, great-tasting unique food selections, and, best of all, great people!  Congrats Dave and Payton!</td>\n",

Let me first just say the two best things are the Mac and Cheese (phenomenal and addicting), and the Buffalo Sloppy Joe sliders. The pork sliders were also good as well as the sweet potato fries.

I HIGHLY recommend waiting in the house next door and having some wine.  The bartenders are very friendly.  The main restaurant will call the house when your table/bar seat is ready.  The pizza is baked in a stone brick oven.  Real firewood is used, not like California Pizza Kitchen's gas oven.  The owner himself makes the pizza.  Every employee is genuinely nice.  With each bite, you have a subtle taste of smoke (not overwhelming).  The crust is thin and crispy...AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...you can fold the slice - for all you NJ/NY natives!  My stomach is churning and mouth salivating as I write more.  I am going to Phoenix this Thursday...guess where I'll be?  PS-Guys, phenomenal eye candy.</td>\n",

Sara V. was hungry so we started with an app, the chicharron quesadilla estilo del rey which is with queso, pico, onions, and jalapenos. I got horchata as a drink, and Sara V. got mango juice. Felt tropical and I guess it went with the feeling of mugginess outside. Anywho, the quesadilla was big, and really a meal in itself. For our entrees we decided to split two tortas, they were the Arizona Torta  and the Mexicana Torta - steak, sauteed onions, jalapenos. They were both big in its own right, half a torta is filling on its own. \n",

       "Sum up our experience, the tortas are really good, altho i can always pass up the Mexicana and try something else. The horchata was alright, nothing phenomenal unlike La Condesa which has a very interesting and really yummy Horchata. Not a big fan of Mexican mangoes coz personally I don't think that they're sweet, Filipino mangoes are still Queen! The quesadilla was yummy, liked it very much. I think it's proof that when more than half their clientele are Latinos is that it's a good torta shop. The dinner was not pricey and I had leftovers but really liked it and will come back soon!</td>\n",
